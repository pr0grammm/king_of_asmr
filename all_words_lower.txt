- hi, i'm certainly glad to see you today,

because i thought today we'd do a painting

that's just a lot of fun.

let's start out and have
them run all the colors

across the screen that you need

to do this little painting with us.

and while they're doing
that, let me show you

this craziness i've got up here today.

today, i took my standard
old pre-stretched

double-primed 18 by 24 inch canvas,

but once again, you can use any size

that's convenient for you.

i just like this size because it fits

a television screen good.

i took a paper towel and acrylic paint,

now we're using oils,
but i used acrylic paint

to put a dry undercoat on here.

now, i just took a paper towel,

and a little bit of sienna and umber,

and just dabbed it, just everywhere.

then here, i found an old
filbert brush and just

pulled a couple things through.

and i allowed all that to dry.

now i've covered the entire
canvas with liquid clear.

the liquid clear just
makes it wet and slick.

that's really all it's there for.

the bottom of the
canvas, then i've covered

with a mixture of sap
green and alizarin crimson.

that makes a gorgeous brown color.

and i thought i'd wait until you got here

to do the top part so you can
see exactly how it's done.

now sometimes when i'm
walking through the woods,

which i do frequently, sometimes the sun's

coming through the trees and
you see this beautiful glow

coming right through the trees.

and some of the trees that
are close to that glow,

they sort of just disappear into it.

and that's the effect i
was trying to achieve.

and i'm gonna show you a
very easy way to make that.

all right.

let's go today, we use a two
inch brush to get started here.

i'm going to go right into

a little bit of the indian yellow.

i like indian yellow because
it's very transparent.

very transparent, it's a gorgeous color.

let's go right up in here.

now with that, right over this acrylic,

with the liquid clear on it.

i'm just going to cover
the entire canvas here.

the entire top part of it.

the bottom is covered
with that brownish color.

there.

just like so.

about like that.

it's really all we have to do right now.

but see how easy that goes on.

if you don't have the clear on there,

the liquid clear, this is
quite a job putting it on.

i've got now since we have the clear,

i use this any time that
i'm using a black canvas.

or a canvas that has some
color or design on it.

it makes it so much easier.

i'll go right into, i made a
little of that brown color.

once again, it's alizarin
crimson and sap green

in about equal parts.

i just went ahead and
mixed up a little pile here

because i'm going to
use a lot of it i think.

and right up here in the corner,
i'll add a little bit more.

i just want to darken this corner.

make it look like a sun's
shining through here.

about like that, and
that's really all we need.

it's all we need.

there.

okay, let me wash the brush.

if you've painted with us before,

you know this is the most fun
part of this whole technique.

we wash it with odorless paint thinner,

shake it off.


 and just beat
the devil out of it.

good way to take out all your
hostilities and frustrations.

i want to take a little
bit of the cadmium yellow

and put it right over here
with some titanium white.

don't need a lot of white.

let's go up in here.

now figure out where the
sun lives in your painting.

i think it's right there.

take the corner of the
brush and we'll start there.

and we'll begin working outward.

i want this to be very bright.

it'd go right over these trees.

i want to just absolutely blend them out

where the light's going to
be zinging through there.

just blend them out.

little more of the white.

there.

right in there.

want that to be very bright.

if that's our hot spot.

that's the source of our
light in this painting.

and you can do this as
many times as you desire

to achieve a desired lightness.

but i suggest each time you do,

get a clean brush or clean your brush.

just depending on how
many brushes you have.

there.

we'll just let this little
glow just work its way out.

already you can see how those
trees are almost disappearing

in that strong direct sunlight.

and that's exactly the effect
that i was trying to achieve.

and this makes it so simple.

so simple.

there.

and then we'll just blend
the entire thing out.

now already, that looks like a
sunlight coming through there

so strong it almost hurts your eyes.

fantastic.

that easy.

all right.

i'll tell you what.

let's use the old filbert brush today.

i like the filbert brush.

i'm just going to go into a little bit

of the titanium white
with the filbert brush.

just load both sides up.

both sides up, something like so.

a lot of color.

fully loaded on both sides.

now maybe in our world back here,

let's make this a winter scene.

it can be winter or summer.

i think we'll do winter today.

maybe back in here we
touch and there's just

a little indication of some
snow that lives back here.

barely touch the canvas.

i want to just graze it.

just graze it.

i want it just to begin picking up

some of that color we have underneath.

just graze it though.

it has that brown underneath

so it's going to pick
up a little bit of that.

all we're doing is just grazing.

sometimes you can put
a lot of paint on there

and just let it bounce along and break

and by break i mean it has all
these little holes in there.

barely touching.

just, let it just drag across the canvas.

allow the canvas to do the work.

let it pull off the paint that it wants.

then what's left on the brush

you can just sort of scrub it in.

and work back and forth.

where you want to highlight,
put it on very thick.

there.

about like that.

now.

as i've mentioned earlier,
i've already mixed up

a large pile here of the
alizarin crimson and sap green

to make a beautiful brown color.

now you can, you can take
that to the reddish side

by adding more crimson
or to the greenish side

depending on your mood.

i usually go a little
more to the reddish side.

i sort of like that.

a lot of color on the brush.

shoot.

we might as well check you out

for bravery right off in this painting.

maybe.

you ready?

maybe  right there.

just pull it down.

a lot of paint on the brush.

very thick, very thick.

let's have a,

let's have a whole grove of trees.

maybe it's wintertime.

these trees have lost their leaves.

lost their leaves.

the snow's just beginning
to collect on the ground.

all the little squirrels and stuff.

they're probably up here hibernating,

taking life easy for the winter.

there.

all right.

if you watch the show in the past,

you know i like little squirrels.

i have a bunch of squirrels.

i raise, well i usually raise anywhere

from two or three to
a half a dozen a year.

turn them loose.

i have the good fortune of working with

a lot of the rehab people
around the country.

here in muncie there's a lovely lady

named diana schaffer that
takes care of animals

and she's taught me a tremendous amount

about all these little creatures.

and in florida there's several

other people that i work with.

i like to work with
animals, and these people,

they work with injured
and orphaned animals

and devote their whole life to it

and i have a great respect for them.

there.

i want these trees instead of

the nice smooth ones we usually make.

let's make some trees
today that have character.

these trees are not going to

end up as future telephone poles.

guarantee you.

i want them to be ragged.

 rough, rough.

that's what my dog said when
he sat down on the sandpaper.

rough.

bad joke.

now i'm pushing because i want

a lot of little things
to happen with the brush.

normally you would pull so
you'd get a smoother line.

i want the roughness today.

i want these trees to look like,

oh, it's been a rough life out here.

see?

pulling the edges out.

really rough.

this is a place you wouldn't want to go

in the middle of a dark night.

it's one of them scary places.

there.

when i was young, there was some places

where i lived that,

they were just sort of scary.

you'd be out the evening
and it started getting dusk,

you could make out all kind of monsters

that lived in there.

there we are.

but we lived way out in the woods.

i grew up in florida.

and we lived so far back in the woods

they used to have to
pipe sunlight into us.

there.

all right.

see how all them all limbs.

we'll come back with a liner brush

and put in a few little ones.

but i really want these
old raggedy looking things.

shoot, i like that.

i want a tree over here.

this is our world, so we can

put trees anywhere we want them.

maybe it comes all the way down to there.

i don't know.

you make that decision.

and this painting's great if
you've never painted before.

this is an easy one.

you can do this one.

you can do this one.

we try to do some paintings in each series

that work so well those
who are just beginning

can have outstanding results with them.

or people who've painted a little bit,

they can just have fun with them.

and we try to do some paintings

that have a little more challenge to them

for those that have painted for a while

and they need a little more challenge.

i'm just taking the brush
and rubbing it up and down.

i want to make the indication of some

little bushes that live way back here.

gotta have a place for my
little friends to hide.

there.

probably, a little racoon
lives right in there.

there we go.

i like little racoons when they're little.

they are the cutest little devils.

i got a letter from
somebody here a while back,

they weren't happy that i was condoning

keeping these animals as pets.

let me emphasize, strongly.

i do not keep these animals as pets.

i only try to help the
rehab people raise them up,

and then they're turned
loose back to the wild,

because that's where god
intended for 'em to be.

i have all these little
squirrels in my backyard

that i've raised, and

it's funny, people come
to the house, 

and they're like little puppies.

i'm not exaggerating,

they literally, they come to my back door,

in fact, they've ate a hole
through my screen on the patio.

but they come through the screen,

and they come to the back door,

and they scratch on the door

like a little puppy,
wanting me to come out

and bring 'em some goodies.

they know i'm a soft touch.



i just decided i was talking so much,

i'm gonna put another tree in.

but isn't this an easy way

to make some gorgeous,
old rough looking trees?

tough old trees.

there we go.

just get a general idea of
where we want 'em to be.

i like that.

now, i've got a couple
of filberts going here,

so i don't have to spend all
my time just cleaning them.

maybe back in our world, here,

just make a decision.



maybe there's some more
snow lives right in there.

i don't know.

you know, painting is
such an individual thing.

don't just try to copy
somebody else's work.

just do your own thing.

we each see nature through
totally different eyes,

and that's what you're to paint.

i say that over and over,
because i just don't,

i don't want to teach people to copy.

shoot, anybody can copy.

creative freedom,
though, is where it's at.

that's really the joy of painting.

there.

we use no patterns, no sketches,

we let our imagination take us to worlds

that we can only imagine.

we can do that.

we can do that, we can do anything.

anything, at least on this canvas we can.

maybe there's another little
bush lives right here.

i've mentioned before, on this canvas,

i have absolute and total power.

i can do anything here my heart desires,

i can change the course of mighty rivers,

anything.

when i go home,

the only thing i have any
power over is the garbage.

it sits there and waits on me.

there we are,

but that's okay.

i can always escape to
this piece of canvas

and create any illusion that i want.

so can you.

maybe there's a big old root on this tree,

it comes right out like that.

like that.

let's put some arms on
this old tree. 

once again, i'm pushing
a lot with the brush,

just to make them all gnarly.

is that a word?

my son steve and i are both
bad about making up words.

i learnt that from him,

he didn't learn it from me, of course.

there we go.

old steve, if you've never had
a chance to watch him paint,

that son of a gun is one dynamite painter.

he's almost, what, 27 years old now.

hey, and this is the 27th series,

what a coincidence.

but he has been painting, i think,

since he was born.

he was about 12 years
old before he realized

everybody didn't paint.

there we go, just a
little snow over there.

we'll just bring that little
bush in the background down.

we're gonna put some sticks and
stuff in these little bushes

and they'll show up a little better.

i hope you can see 'em.

alright.

let's go back to this big old tree.

on this side, this is really
an exercise in making trees.

there it comes, there
it comes, there it goes.

think about these old limbs
that hang out here and there.

now you could just as easy

have done this painting
in summer or spring.

and put leaves on all these trees.

i just decided today,

i wanted to do a scene that,
as i mentioned when we started,

i like to walk in the woods.

sometimes when i walk in
the woods in the winter,

the sun comes through so strong,

and you have this gorgeous effect.

i sit down, and i watch
this for a long time,

and i kept thinking about
how would i make that?

and how could i do it easy?

i knew how to do it as
a traditional painter,

it's a very time consuming,

you have to let things dry between layers,

and put some washes and glazes on there.

but i wanted the way

where somebody could do this very quickly,

and easily, without all the agony.

and this is what i've come up with,

i think it works.

now this is acrylic paint, as i say.

it dries very rapidly,
it's not very good for

doing wet on wet,

cause you depend on the canvas staying wet

through the entire painting.

doesn't work very well for that.

but for this, where you
need a dry, undercolor,

it works great.

i will tell you, there is some controversy

in the art world at this time,

as to whether putting acrylic under oil

is a permanent medium.

i don't know.

i really don't know at this point.

i have been talking with some manufacturer

of art products though, and,

about the possibilities of
making some other products

that there will be no controversy about.

so maybe one day, they'll
have something like that.

hopefully not too far in the future,

cause i like to design new products.

that makes painting easy,

and makes it work for people.

there we are.

i'm fascinated with
machinery and et cetera,

for a long time, in college,
i was an engineering student.

wanted to be a mechanical engineer.

instead of building bridges,
i'd rather paint 'em.

a lot of that rubbed off, i think.

i'm gonna take a little bit of that white,

put a little touch of the brown into it.

maybe a little black, just to grey,

oh, i like that, just to grey it a little.

i want to grey it.

lot of color on the brush,

don't be afraid of color, a lot of color.

i like sorta hold this
thing like i would a pencil.

so that it's very loose, now then.

touch, and let this dance.

let it play,

let it pick up that color,

let it leave its own color,

let all these things
happen, don't fight it.

no pressure.

absolutely no pressure.

there's your light, it's
gonna come across there.

no pressure, no pressure.

here it comes, here it comes.

just highlight it, with no pressure.

let me get a little more
black on the brush to grey it.

there we go.

but you need a lot of color on the brush

so when you touch it,
it'll just pull right off.

there.

see that?

isn't that fantastic?

just with an old filbert brush,

you can just about do
this entire painting,

with just an old filbert brush.

up to you.

there we are.

i'll have this one come right on through.

but i'm turning the brush
to get all the paint,

and it creates different
effects as it's turning,

and wiggling and jiggling.

there.

darker and darker as it comes around,

cause you want this side next to the light

to be the lightest of course.

you do that.

there.

look at that.

all we need up here is a big old hoot owl,

it'd look like halloween.

there.

alright.

one of the other shows, i
showed some footage that

i had taken with a great big owl.

in fact it was a great horned owl.

that rascal bit me on the nose, there.

alright, let's do this to
a couple other trees here.

as i say, this whole painting
is mainly just an exercise

in painting trees,

but when you get it done,

people will think you
labored over this painting

for long periods of time.

shh, don't tell them any different.

don't tell them any different.

there.

just let it go, fall right along the edge.

there we are.

now if you have a lot of time,

which we don't here,

but if you have a lot of time,

you could take a very thin paint,

thin it with paint thinner and

put it on the script liner brush.

a little black in there.

and using it sidewards,

just pull it down and let it
just graze the high points

here of that brown.

it'll make some gorgeous effects.

it does take a little
longer than doing this.

try it, you may like it better than this.

if you do, then use it.

we want to show you as many
different ways as possible

of creating effects.

what you create then, is totally
and completely up to you.

there, put a little bit over
here on this old monster.

see, but very loose.

very, very loose.

there we are.

something about like so.

alright.

let me wipe off the old brush.

little more of the white paint,

and we can just sort of fill this in.

want this to be very rough looking.

this paint's thick.

in fact, in ways, it looks
like a traditional painting

when it's done, you can
go back with glazes.

glazes just made from,
oh, you can make glazes

from something like a
little paint thinner,

a little linseed oil, a little color.

can make all kinds of beautiful glazes,

add a little transparent color to it.

you guessed it, 

i need a big tree.

lives right there.

this tree, i'm gonna
sort put it at an angle,

so it looks like it's, maybe
it's bent over a little bit.

there we go.

big old legs sticking right out there.

big tree.

big, big tree.

yeah, there he comes.

alright.

there.

see, it doesn't matter if you
pick up some of that color,

it makes it look good.

big old limbs hanging out on him.

right across that one, we don't care.

see, don't be afraid of it.

do it, enjoy it.

it's what makes it fun.

back to our brush that
has the light color on it.

come back in here.

there, see?

just let it play and have fun.

there, look at that.

you know, i've got several
letters commenting on

this easel that i'm using in this series.

this is a brand new easel
that has just been released.

i'm very happy with this easel.

what makes it so great, the top comes off.

if makes a wonderful table top easel

with four legs instead
of the traditional three.

it's much stronger.

it works for this kind
of painting, very well.

there, little bit of that white,

we can add just a little
white around his foots.

about like that.

there, once again, no pressure,

allow that paint just to break on there.

just allow it to break.

maybe there's a happy little bush

that lives right there.

maybe there's another one over in here.

just here and there,
some little bushy things.

there, a little touch there.

take a liner brush, put
some paint thinner on it.

there, go right into that brown.

and we can just snatch up a few little

sticks and twigs, here and there.

but see, this painting was done with

very, very few pieces of equipment.

very few colors of paint,

there's not a lot to it, it's easy.

you can do this one.

even if you've never painted,

this is one that you can do.

and your friends and your family,

they won't believe you done it.

they really won't.

in fact, i've had people write and say

their friends actually
started looking for numbers

on their painting, like
it was a paint by number.

they thought they just
covered the numbers up.

now you can go back in here,

and here and there,

put the indication of a few
limbs and twigs and sticks

and things, but i don't want
these to be real smooth.

i want them rough, so they follow along

with what's happening in this painting.

very rough, ragged.

wherever you think they should be.

gnarly, i like that world, gnarly.

there we go.

see there?

all kinds of hangy-downs.

all kinds of 'em, wherever
you think they should be.

there.

alright.

mmm, yeah that looks like
a halloween picture to me.

and we can put some out in here.

and at home, when you do this,

take your time.

do a lot of these, they really,

all these little hangy down things here

are absolutely fantastic.

you'll enjoy them.

they make your painting
look like, once again,

like you spent so much time on it.

and only we know, that it was very easy.

there, and if you enjoy success with this,

you won't believe what you can do.

this just opens doors

to a world of art,

that'll take you places you've
only dreamed about going.

alright, tell you what.

think we about got a finished one here,

let's take a little red,

sign this one, and we'll call it done.

hope you've enjoyed it.

i'd love to see some
photographs of your work,

if you have time, send me a couple.

let me see what you're doing.

from all of us here,

i'd like to wish you happy painting,

and god bless, my friend.



- hi, welcome back.

certainly glad you could join us today,

because today we're going to
have just a fantastic time.

let's start out and have
'em run all the colors

across the screen, that you
need to paint along with us.

while they're doing that,

let me show you what's happening up here.

i thought today i'd show ya

how to use a black, white and grey gesso

to make a fantastic effect.

now i've taken these
three colors of gesso,

and using an old liner brush,

one that i didn't care anything about,

i've just made some little tree shapes.

that's all there is to it.

you just pull it down with a liner brush,

make a little limb here and there,

and then take the liner brush sidewards,

and put in these little fluffy areas.

it sorta looks like leaves.

but that's really all there is to it.

after it's totally dry, completely dry,

i've covered the entire canvas with

a very thin coat of liquid clear.

now clear is transparent,

and you have a tendency
to put too much of it on.

if you have any doubt in your mind,

and you think you may have too much,

take a paper towel and
wipe your canvas down.

what's left will be just right.

tell you what, let's do it.

this is a fun painting
that anybody can do.

this is a good one.

if it's your first or second painting,

this is wonderful.

if you've painted before,

this is one that'll, it
will certainly excite you.

i'll start with a little phthalo blue.

it's a beautiful,
beautiful blue, i love it.

think it's one of the
nicest colors that we have.

just put a little in the two inch brush,

and let's go up in here.

there's not a lot of paint on the brush.

and i'm just gonna start

and just make my little
criss-cross strokes, as usual,

and paint right over this.

and fantastic things will happen.

look at that.

already, it looks like, it looks like

the sky is showing
right through the trees.

this is one of the neatest effects.

and it's not limited to this,

you can do anything with this gesso.

there.

and where the canvas is dark,

i've used lighter gesso, and vice versa.

look at there,

see already we have a basic background in,

and done.

let's see, while i got
that blue on my brush,

i'm gonna add a little
more of the prussian blue,

cause it's stronger, it'll
go right over the top.

in the corners, i'm gonna darken a little,

with prussian blue.

prussian blue is much stronger.

much deeper.

see there, there we go.

just the corners though.

and that, in turn, will
make this look brighter.

if you make this darker,
this gets lighter.

now,

we've got prussian blue on the brush.

i'll just sort of rub a little of that

right here on the canvas.

i know you can't see anything,

but when we put a little color on there,

beautiful things will happen.

there.

alright, ready to wash the old brush?

that's the fun part.

that's the fun part.

let's wash it.

as you know, we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner

just scrub 'em off, give it a good shake.



 and cover the entire studio.

that's really the fun part of it.

now sometimes,

when you're walking in the woods,

which i do quite frequently,

and you look out and you see
the light coming through,

it's so bright, it just, it
burns right through the trees.

watch, watch, it's easier to show you.

take the brush,

i'm just gonna take one corner.

just one corner.

that's a beautiful close-up there.

one corner,

and get a little titanium white on it.

now come up here.

decide where the sun's at back there,

shining through all these trees.

and very lightly just begin,

that light area, and begin working around.

notice that we're keeping that corner

in the light spot.

and we work around and
around and around we go,

there we are, see there?

and begin blending outward.

now this paint is very opaque.

we've used transparent color up until now,

and now we're getting into opaque color.

but that sun's burning through there.

light's just zinging right through.

but by blending it out,

it'll become transparent enough

that you can still see the
tree shapes through there.

that's what we're trying to achieve.

to me, that's what it
looks like when i see

the sun shining through.

there.

you can still make out the
images of the trees in there,

but they're washed out.

the same as if you're looking at 'em

in the woods, and the
sun shinings through.

just like that, and we
can blend a little light

right on down through here.

up to you, up to you,

you decide where it lives.

you decide.

there.

now you could do this several times

to achieve a desired lightness,

or a desired brightness.

this is about all that i want.

i just want that nice spot
shining through there strong.

i like that when that happens.

okay.


actually, i just wanted
to clean the brush again.

already, we're in business.

now we have to make some big decision.

what's happening here in our world?

let's take some black,

and some prussian blue.

i'll be right back, i'm
gonna get a little crimson

and put in there too.

tell you what, maybe even a
little sap green, a little brown

a little van dyke,

just all the dark colors,
it doesn't matter.

okay, let's go up here.

now in my mind,

i see back in here,

maybe a little grassy area that lives

right underneath these trees,

so i'll just tap them a little dark.

don't need much because the black gesso

has created most of it.

we don't have to worry about it.

about like that, that's
all we're looking for.

there.

just let it disappear back in there.

hmm, okay.

same brush, i'm gonna go
right into some cad yellow,

some yellow ochre.

let's just load some
color on the brush here.

tap it, push it, give
it a little .

see that little ridge
of paint right there?

it's what we're looking for.

let's go back up here.

now we can come back with
this beautiful green color,

and just begin tapping in the indication

of some little grassy
areas that live far away.

far away, very soft.

very soft.

there, sneak 'em around
some of those trees.

there.

reload the brush as you need it.

alright, but very gently.

all you do is barely touching the canvas.

color shows up, it seems
like 100 times better,

stronger on a black canvas than it does

on a white canvas.

it's amazing what happens to color.

there.

see, wherever you want 'em to be.

wherever.

maybe, maybe a little,

a little projection
sticks out right there.

maybe, maybe, maybe.

we can make a little bump,

just by doing that,

whatever you want, you decide.

alright.

now, i'm gonna grab
another two inch brush,

i have several of 'em.


make sure it's good and dry.

small amount of titanium white on it.

now we put color on here.

even though it doesn't look like it,

there's a little bit of
that blue that we put on.

very gently pull down.

don't put a lot of color on here.

it shows up, once again, so bright.

you need very, very
little white to do this.

very little.

and it's important that
you pull it straight down.

straight down, okay.

then we go across.

just enough to make it look like

a little watery area under here.

now you could just as easy have painted

those trees with the gesso in the water,

and reflected 'em.

i think in the last
series, or series before,

i sorta lose track of them,

i think we done that, and it's gorgeous.

you can do it.

you can do it.

now, shoot, that worked pretty good.

i'm gonna go back and get some dark.

that was black, blue and
oh, crimson, whatever.

i want another one over here.

i like that one so well.

look at here, we'll just
put us another little

little projection that comes
right out through here.

little dark color in there.

there.

okay, back into our yellows,
indian, yellow ochre.

cadmium yellow.

also i hit a bright
red, believe it or not,

red will dull the color,

cause red and green make brown.

so every once in a while,

i hit a little bit of the bright red,

sometimes more to dull
than to make things bright.

there.

just begin forming this.

just begin working with it.

think about the lay of the land.

just drop those little devils in there.

they're everywhere.

there.

but isn't that gesso,

it's one of the most fantastic ideas

we've ever come up with.

colored gessos are really wonderful.

there.

don't know why we didn't
do this a long time ago,

it makes like so much
easier when you're painting.

and you can put things in like,

like if you wanted to paint
a little house or a building,

you could do it all with the gesso,

and then basically, all you need to do is

just take, put some clear over it,

come back with a little color.

and it's there, that quick.


take a little bit of the,

little bit of the titanium white,

and i'm gonna put a little
touch of reflection under here.

just a touch, just a touch.

don't want a lot.

want to keep this pretty dark,

so that light area back
here really shines.

there we go.

about like that, then once again,

just go across, just go across,

that's all there is to it.

isn't that easy?

i knew you'd like this one.

i think it's one of my favorite paintings

in the whole series.

it's so easy, it's great for people who

are just beginning to paint,

and just beginning to
experience the joy of painting.

hey, there's a commercial!

alright, let's put some stones in there.

we'll put some little stones.

i'm gonna take some,

i'm gonna take some black
and a little van dyke brown,

put it in there, just mix it up real good.

little dark sienna too, what the heck,

little more of the sienna.

okay, now i'm gonna go over here,

and get some paint thinner.

i'm gonna thin this paint
down, til it's very thin.

remember our golden rule,

a thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

we'll thin that down.

there, that's good.

that's good, let me clean the knife.

we'll take some white,

oh, we'll use a little dark sienna,

a little van dyke brown,

i'm gonna make a highlight
color for the rocks.

oh, i like that, that's good.

it's not too bright.

okay, do the same thing again.

i'm gonna thin this
paint with paint thinner,

til it's pretty thin, pretty thin.

it's about the consistency
of soft face cream.

or butter that you've left out.

you know, sometime you
leave the butter out,

it gets real soft and gooey,

that's what we're looking for.

okay, let me clean off my knife.

now probably the easiest
way i've ever found

of making very effective little stones,

is using a little filbert brush.

okay, and let's go through
the dark color first.

both sides, okay, stay right there

and i'll bring the light up.

we have both sides full of dark.

i'm gonna take only one
side, and go through light.

so we have light, dark, light, dark.

now we can go back in here,

and you have to make big decisions.

where does all these
little rocks and stones

live in your world?

you can put a million of 'em in.

or one or two, it's up to you.

i like little stones.

this is the easiest way,
there he is, that i know of

to put them in there.

maybe over here, they're
getting a little bigger.

big old rock.

but in one stroke, you can put

the top and the bottom of the rock in,

that easy.

let's put some on the other side.

we don't want him left out.

there.

look at all those little rocks.

i used to agonize over rocks,

trying to get them in there,

worked myself to death.

and, you see how easy it is.

if you want great big rocks,

then use our little oval brush.

the one that just jumps right in there.

i'm gonna take a little liner brush,

a little bit of white,
a little blue in it,

a little phthalo blue in it.

mostly white.

instead of using the knife today,

i'm just gonna take the liner brush,

and just here and there,

sort of work a little water
line right around the stones,

like that, look at there,

just let it wander around.

wherever you want it.

wherever you want it.

it just cleans up the edge,

and the bottom of these little rocks.

there.

see there, then they can
come on out through here,

they can be a few little things.

you could do this with a
knife if you wanted to.

i thought today, we'll just do
it with a little liner brush.

but you need a thin paint.

so it'll just zip right over there.

there we go.

something like that, when you do yours,

take your time and really,
really do 'em nice.

we're a little pressed for time here,

so i have to do it a little quicker.

but when you do it,
just enjoy it, enjoy it.

alright.

we gotta put something
in our foreground here.

we'll just go back to our brush that's

got all that dark on it.

we had blue and black and some brown.

see, sap green, alizarin crimson,

bravery test, .

maybe in our world it comes
right across like that.

there, just tap that in.

just tap it in.

fill it up.

fill it up, a lot of

good dark color in there.

there.

now then.

okay.

let's go into our yellow,

same thing as we did before.

i'm just gonna do the same basic thing.

get some green here.

by taking that color we had on the brush

and going into yellow,
automatically, we get green.

and then we can begin
just putting all kinds

of little grassy areas back in here.

there they come, there they come.

if you just take your time,
and you keep tapping this,

it'll get so smooth, you
almost can't believe it.

there.

just little soft grassy areas.

there they go, right on out.

there, a little more paint on the brush.

alright.

just keep working it
back and forth though.

something like that.

okay.

just sort of let your imagination go.

painting is so great,

because your imagination
on that piece of canvas

can become reality.

can become reality, and sometimes,

we all need to escape from reality.

this is the place to do it.

here, everything's peaceful and quiet.

there's no bad things here,
these are happy places here.

now, watch here, watch here, watch.

sometimes, come right up in here.

sometimes it's fun to take this brush,

put it up here, and give it
a little upward push, watch.

bloop, see that little grassy area?

bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

that's all there is to it.

gotta make those noises
though, or it doesn't work.

there, just like that.

maybe the grass over
here is a little taller.

you work in layers.

there.

and we can go back to just tapping.

like that.

there.

and then maybe, bloop, yep you're right,

there's another, bloop, bloop.

a little glassy area right there.

wherever you want 'em.

and over here, it's much softer.

much, much softer.

over here's where you'd wanna,

you wanna take your shoes off,

and run through there with naked foots.

that'd be fun, i like the feel of grass

on the bottom of my feet with no shoes on.

i think that's a neat feeling.

there.

when we were kids, my brother jim and i,

we used to run all through
the woods in florida.

shoot, we were tough, we didn't
even wear shoes back then.

probably because we didn't have any.

bloop.

more little grassy areas, there.

just as many as you want.

you know what we need?

you know, don't ya?

we need a tree.

let's take some van dyke,
a little dark sienna,

mix them together with an old fan brush.

and let's have a bravery test, right now.

 here we go.

i want a tree that lives right there.

oh, right through the pretty rocks.

it's okay, we know they're back there.

just pull it through, .

like that.

big strong tree.

see, it just keeps growing.

can always make them bigger.

sometimes, it's a son of a gun to try

to make them smaller,

but you can always make them bigger.

put a big old foot on him out here,

so he has something to stand on.

there.

tell you what, let's just
use a little filbert.

we'll take a little white, a little brown.

and just, just let that
work right down the edge.

that's too bright, i don't
like that, too bright.

let me darken it up a little.

too bright, oh that's much better.

that's much better.

see, if you don't like
something, change it.

in your world, you have
that kind of power.

you can do anything.

anything.

there, see it gives the impression

of an old rough mean tree
lives out here. 

there he is, we need
some arms on our tree.

let me wipe that color off.

liner brush, there he is.

little paint thinner,
little van dyke brown.

there we go.

and in our world, there's
an arm lives on this tree.

right there, there he is.

put a few arms, let's put
some leaves on this tree,

so we don't have to put many arms.

maybe there's one that
hangs off here that, mmm,

there.

now let's put a few leaves on there.

we get a fan brush,

take some dark color, black, blue.

maybe a little sap green,
and crimson in it too.

and our world, there it is.

push in a little dark first.

there, don't wanna
cover up all that trunk,

but some of it.

there we go.

gives us an idea of where
some nice limbs are.

i'm gonna go right into
the yellow with that color,

since it had blue in it,
we'll have instant green.

there, and push upward again.

sometime we push down,

sometime upward.

let me get a little more color on here.

it's up to you.

up to you, there it comes.

see, don't want to get
too much of this in here.

just enough to make
this old tree stand out

and sing in the sunshine.

right there.

there it is.

there.

okay.

now we can take our old

number two inch brush right
here, and put a little grass

around his foots.

i'm still feeling crazy,
and i got a minute left.

i like to do this because it,

it upsets my director when
we're getting low on time,

and i do something like .

maybe there's an old
tree, fell down. 

this old tree just fell
down, it was tired.

he's a tired old tree,
and i can relate to that.

put a little highlight
along his edge here.

just use a little brown and white.

that was just van dyke
brown we made him with,

just like the one standing up.

this one, this one he's
laying down on the job.

laying down on the job.

that's okay, he had a long life.

now he wants to rest.

we'll put a few old limbs
that are still on here.

some coming out from
the side, and going out.

there, if you had trouble
making this slide,

all you gotta do is just add a little more

paint thinner to it.

there, see whole limbs are just,

just handing around out here.

there we are.

go into a little bit of

white, brown, like a lighter color.

and we can highlight those a
little, just so they stand out.

something like that.

there.

there, old tree's just
laying out there asleep.

now then.

let's go back and get our brush

that's got the dark color on it.

i want a little, i want a
little bush living right here,

so i'll put one in.

in your world, you put them
in anywhere you want 'em.

put some dark in.

go into a little bit of light,

i'm gonna use a little
into the yellow ochre side,

a little touch.

nah, want more yellow ochre than that.

if you're not happy with it, change it.

oh, that's better, now i'm happier.

there we go.

there we go, all kinds of little things.

like that.

see, you can put these in
anywhere that you want 'em.

just any old place.

just to make it look
like theres a little bush

right here on the edge.

it goes right off the canvas.

happy little bush.

okay.

back to our little liner brush.

little light brown color on it.

and here and there and there,

we can put in a stick or a twig.

whatever you think,

just a couple.

and, we had rocks on the other side,

let me go back to my filbert

that had the rock color on it.

any maybe over here, there's a rock or two

that lives on this side.

i know that side's better,

but all the rocks didn't move over there.

there's still a couple here.

still a couple, where do they live?

here's one right up against a tree.

yeah, wherever you want 'em, you decide.

there.

maybe right down here at
the base of that big tree,

lives a little stone.

you make the decision, but
he may live right there,

that's okay.

shoot, i think we're about ready

for a signature on this one.

take a little paint thinner, a
little bit of the bright red,

and we'll sign it.

i have people write and they say

"do you have to sign with red?"

absolutely not, you sign
with any color that you want.

i just sorta got in the
habit of signing with red,

and i always do it.

it's sorta became a trademark,

but you sign in any color that you want.

there we are.

i think we're gonna
call that one finished.

hope you've enjoyed it.

i'd like to hear from you,

if you try this black
and white and grey gesso,

because it does fantastic things.

from all of us here, i'd like to wish you

happy painting, and god bless, my friend.



hey welcome back certainly glad you

could join me again today

got your palace set up let's get going

here

let's start off from having graphically

run all the colors across the screen

that you need to do this painting with

me and they'll come across as usual in

the same order that i have them on the

palette starting with the white and

working around while they're doing that

let's go on up here i've already covered

the canvas with a thin even coat of

liquid white it's nice and wet and slick

and all ready to go

i thought maybe today let's do a little

fall scene where maybe the weather is

not too great you know in the fall we

have a lot of rainy weather now you know

the snows gonna come pretty soon so

let's do something like yet and just

just have some fun i'm gonna start out

using a small a small amount of yellow

ochre just the tiniest little bit a very

small amount and right here sort of make

a determination where the horizons gonna

be and i'm gonna begin swinging this

upward just using strokes like so a

little bit more color don't have a

little water in this paint as you know

i'm i'm sort of a water fanatic like

that water little yellow in here okay

i'm gonna go right into some van dyck

brown in the same way just tap the brush

into it okay let's go right up here put

a little brown right in here i'm

beginning to create these sky angles

just don't let him get too too straight

like this it'll it'll disturb you when

it's done

now i'm gonna take brown and a touch of

prussian blue let me say that again

a dutch prussian blue is so strong just

a little bit miss brown and blue okay

yes we can bring that all together add a

touch of the midnight black to it so now

we have in the sky we have a little bit

of yellow ochre some brown sort of

pression blue and some midnight black

we just gonna sort of work all of these

baskerville colors together try to keep

the blue off that yellow or you'll get a

very pretty sky and then before we start

blending them we still have a dirty old

brush and we'll take some more the

prussian blue and a little bit of the

black there we go and let's go ahead and

lay our water in both on the outside in

see if you start if you start from here

and go across watch what happens you

touch here and go across you get this

big line that's bad and then it's hard

to blend out so starting the outside and

come over and that way you don't have

that harsh line that you have to blend

out there we go little tricks like that

save ya save you a lot of agony we want

this to be easy we want it to work for

you okay a little bit more of the

midnight black compression blue mixture

don't want to kill all that nasty yellow

area that you have because of blue

little black ball heat it up in a

heartbeat okay a little darker at the

bottom then there's at the top that'll

help create your illusion of distance

okay let me wash the old brush wash the

old brush shake off the excess that is

the fun part

okay let's go right back up here and i'm

gonna begin blending this together

follow the angles in the sky i'm gonna

use long strokes

start in the light area and work up

toward the darker area that way you

brush is dirty when it gets to the top

use your clean brush in the lighter and

you can just begin bringing all this

together

all of those angles though okay that

gives us a quick happy little sky down

here we just go all the way across

straightens out the water and brings it

all together

and we're ready then i get a little fan

brush here we'll mix up

let's take a little black a little

ground a tiny bit of oppression blue and

a little bit of alizarin crimson into

that i'll put some white here and put a

little bit of that into it yeah add a

little more blue to that and the touch

more crimson there we go

that's sort of what i'm looking for so a

very dark lavender to the blue side it's

very dark it's almost a gray color this

is gonna be a great cloudy day okay let

me wipe off my knife now let's take the

old fan brush and go right through a

little bit of color don't need a lot of

paint on the brush yet stab just a

little and a small amount of brown into

that a little a little more into the

brownish color there we go

good let's go right up here now back in

here you have to make a decision maybe

their lives some happy little evergreens

just take the corner of the brush just

back and forth

just sort of pop in just a little

evergreen some indications are some that

are even farther away all we see is just

the basic shapes i'm just touching and

sort of pulling it downward so he's make

all cants a little basic shapes see

touch use a top part of the brush if you

just give it a little downward snap

there a little more paint on the brush

maybe over here we got some to be

careful of these will get looking like

fence posts that's good enough yeah i

want to put a few more indication of

some trees that have a little more shape

to them and we're just using the corner

of the brush and just work them in back

and forth these little trees live right

in your fan brush sometimes you have to

sort of scare them out there and you

just put as many or as few as you want

in your world

there we go

he's got a little friend there just drop

them in yeah then i want to create the

illusion of mist back here i want this

to be very soft and very distant so

we'll take the 2 inch brush and tap i'm

using a top corner see look how hard is

hitting it's bending

really getting here and tap it and you

can create the illusion of very very

soft area back here you've let it come

up above some of these they're really

softened so these trees are already

there already just lost ready to be

missed

can you believe how that pushes all that

back

just that little tapping action ok man

now listen let's have another plane in

the painting and a plane i mean just

another area that's closer to you

so we'll take those same old colors

we'll use some brown i'm gonna put some

dark sienna in there this toe and a

little bit of sap green as things get

closer we'll begin to see a little more

detail just a little sap green though ok

brushes are really full of paint let's

go right up in here there it is these

trees are a little closer they're a

little bit bigger

look at that turn it over over to use

both sides of it there we go this trees

stronger he's he got a little more light

okay we don't want him to get lonely so

we'll give him a friend too you know

friends are so important finally the

trees but to us

and through painting i have made oh i've

made hundreds and hundreds of new

friends all over the country and that

may be the most rewarding part of all

this most thrilling part there i take it

one here's a happy little tree you is

right there just sort of just sort of

visualize in your mind where you think

tria true you'd be happy and you put him

in there just put him in de take a

little bit of the dark sienna and just

tap it onto this brush and then i want

to gather up some of this color that we

had on a tree and begin very softly

putting in little hills okay there see

pick up some of that tree color and just

let it just let it go there was a tiny

bit of dark sienna on the brush tiny bit

tiniest little bit see how you can set

those trees out up on a little hill and

they may be getting pulling that down i

don't want this to be very very soft

very quiet i like very gentle little

paintings that when you're doing yours

at home if you want it to be brighter

and stronger just use a little stronger

color cause painting is a very

individual thing there

okay now let's go right back into here

and load up just load that fan brush

full of paint okay tell you what let's

do let's have a tree that lives right

there yeah we take just the corner of

the brush and if we can't working him

down then you can just push that all

free right out of that brush a little

more paint gonna push it hard when you

get down this far when you first start

you're pushing quite easy by the time

you get down here yeah getting tough

with it just wrong with it

little more color okay i'll tell you

what just do it right here big side of a

gun see all these different sizes of

trees help create the illusion of

distance depth in your painting a

beginning to look like follow you sort

of a mean old sky okay now then the mogu

back into a little tiny tiny a little

bit of the dark sea and a tiny can't say

that enough times and i'm gonna create

another plane here i'm gonna pick up

some of the tree color see ya and all

i'm doing is just tapping the canvas

just half i will bring you right on

cross add the least little touch more of

the sin there see it creates a whole

nother plane and pushes all those trees

back here back into the distance and

that's you

now i'm gonna have water here so let's

take a little bit of that color you just

pull it down so we have a little

reflection i'm using just a little bit

of the dark see i'm a little van dyck

brown on the brush to pull down and

create a reflection here just a just a

happy little reflection like right there

and it likely go across okay now then

then we'll take the same old brush

without cleaning it just same old dirty

brush and tap right into a little bit of

the yellow ochre and the bright red and

just tap it gently see just tap ok now

then here this is a little closer so

we're beginning to see an indication of

some highlights and same way just gently

gently tapping that was bright red and a

tiniest little touch of that yellow okay

now the red is very strong be careful

with it be careful of it it'll eat up

your whole world in just a second take a

little brown it was dark sienna mixed

together pull it out cut across get that

small roll of paint right on the edge of

the knife okay just a little lay on

dedication scrubbing across the canvas

tiny's little bit add a little white to

that same color like that and then it's

just an indication of a touch of

highlight here i don't i don't want much

highlight in this just to touch here a

little bit of the liquid white got

across it and we'll put just an

indication of a little water right not

too much not too bright okay yeah then

go back into my browns cnn the van dyke

and i'm gonna grab some more this tree

color i'm gonna put a little peninsula i

think it comes right out here and when

you're doing this just step back and

look at your painting and make make

decisions just make decisions pull a

little bit of this color down just a

little go gently gently across the house

same old dirty brush back into my yellow

ocher and bright red mixture just a

little same old dirty brush you can get

over here and a little bit of this cad

yellow to it sorry yeah see follow the

angles of the land the lay of the land

just follow it right on to have a

brighter on top and it darker darker

darker as it works down if you want to

show a little protrusion here see see

easy that is creates the illusion have

another little hill just by changing the

value of the color for the intensity a

little bit of that right down to the

water go across you have instant

reflections let's play a little bit over

here tell you what this do we use a

round brush and go right into my browns

us the sienna and the van dyck

tap out the excess just go up here

back in here there's some happy little

trees maybe maybe these are the birch

trees and there we back in the distance

just put some little indications thanks

like so use the old script planner brush

just take it a little paint thinner on

it to go right into the brown turn it

bring it to a sharp point

let's put just a few basic very basic

indications of a tree branch here in

there little tree trunk i'm not looking

for a lot of detail same old dirty brush

now go into a small small amount of the

yellow ocher and the bright red smallest

little mouth i'm just barely touching

then i want to just touch right at the

top here put some indications begin

forming some basic little patterns some

little shapes into your trees don't just

throw these on the random i know i say

that in every show but i get the most

letters about that i said my my tree

shapes don't look right and that's

normally normally the problem 99% of the

time the problem is as a color is just

throw it on at random so to look at it

practice it a little bit of practice

here will pay you tremendous dividends

tremendous dividends

just a few little bushes and all kinds

of things okay tell you what a little

brown let's put a little land area right

there see right there i need a little

bit of a highlight color that's just a

little brown and white not too much just

a little here little bit of a liquid

white catus a little waterline i'm going

right back into the browns i have yet to

wash this brush i've been going back and

forth between the browns and highlight

colors and now i'm gonna put another

little peninsula the libs right there so

you don't care if the bottom of it sort

of comes down because you just pull that

down mm-hmm that easy that easy makes a

little reflections and then lightly like

they go across go right into our color

now the ochre bright red little indian

yellow here and there and they'll care

yellow but a few little highlights on it

okay i mean say ed you can put a little

land under that just a little dirt just

a little dirt like so

and maybe take a little liquid black

maybe there's a happy little tree dude

lives right out there there we go he

lives out on this little peninsula give

me little foots to stand on don't him

don't him to fall over he's a strong

little tree but all kinds of little

films there we go

few little sticks and twigs down here

and when you're doing this at all you

put as many sticks and threes as you

want in there okay back to my browns

with surplus bills let's build a little

more here come right down here so to

fill all this up i just see all kinds of

things

oh - maybe about there once again when

you work in layers working stages

completing the most distant area first

and working forward always working

forward tell you what miss let's have

some fun

we'll put a little cabin back here a

little house would it be nice to live

here and watch all the big canadian

geese come in and right there that's

where a little house will be we'll give

them a little roof just pulling over

right down there we go all i'm doing

here is blocking in color just pakka get

some color

okay we'll take some white from the dark

sienna little bit of van dyke brown

probably got flat a little roll of paint

okay i have there's some boards in this

old building that go this way see they

come right across like yeah doop doop

doop well cut him off but that dark and

then maybe down here just maybe a little

log cabin

there's my the indication of some things

going like here look at that look at

that it's now darker cut on this side

just put some indications and we need

something on the roof i had a little

fright red duster color just a tiny bit

and right down the roof here just better

knife sort of basket boo boo boo boo boo

boo boo got to make that noise or don't

work didn't work don't take at least a

little bit of light color just a little

white or something i'm just a highlight

that so it stands out and you can see it

just so you can see it dark down in here

maybe maybe this house had stolons

underneath you just take the point of

the knife in and just very quickly just

scratching in some basic hole stones he

has a basement in his house he's really

got a fancy cabin out here

and get the little toy for a second okay

take a little bit of the venn diagram

let's have him adorn maybe he's got one

door right down here so we can come

right in the basement cut that right off

where you want it he was just a little

white on the knife to sort of highlight

that and it will take a small agent

knife little bit of prussian blue just

put the indication of a few little

windows in there i'm that easy makes us

a happy little thing okay let's go back

to to bouncing right into some of this

color bright red yellow ocher cad yellow

yeah let's come right down in here oh

that's a pretty light now if you have

any trouble at all we can your paint

stick add a little tiny tiny bit okay

liquid white or paint thinner

whichever good white will change your

color a little bit make it a little

brighter

one don't take the little knife again

come right in here we'll put a happy

little path coming out he's got that way

to get down to the lake catch a big fish

it goes down here that'll bit of land

some stones here and there just whatever

brown and white for some highlights

there we go now that let's go back into

our ogres and reds and indian yellow and

let's begin bringing this right down i

like this little painting because it

really does give you the feeling of fall

just like little layers little things

happening all down through here i'll

tell you what maybe right in here is a

little tree maybe that's just a little

maybe maybe that's a little birch tree

like birch trees and they usually grow

in clumps so you're gonna put several

evan three aware that birch tree grows

by itself

he's a community tree little bit of

liquid black yeah we can just put the

indication of a happy little them here

and there that really helps push your

little cabin back further into the

painting much further back tell you what

tell you let's have some fun let's go

back into the browns put another little

peninsula right there and in your world

you put as many or as few of these as

you want just want to show you how to do

it and turn you loose on the world all

that straight down cow right across go

right back into my highlight colors that

yell up hookers and their heads just

come right out here say they're you know

happy highlights now won't take my fan

brush again go right into the ben dyke

brown darks and i just mix them together

okay right here right here

right somewhere right here yeah just

make a decision drop it down big old

tree bagel tree and this big tree will

help push everything in your painting

back helps create much much more depth

than your painting give it a big hole

they go root stand on down here the big

tree has to be grouped just make an

indication of all they own that comes

right out just tap it on a fan brush man

we can take a little bit of the bright

red darks and white together i think so

let's cut across it let's go up here and

just put some highlights on use these

warm colors we're gonna make it feel

like fall hmm i'm gonna get my coat out

and start seeing if it's all right just

a few little highlights here in there

andy back to my liner brush and right

into the liquid black i said let's have

some blooms that are just hanging there

every which way just drop some of these

in there is a line wherever you wanna

pull them out

see there and you can make all kinds of

beautiful things happen there bill

thank this one's getting close to being

done but a little the ground area right

in here touch a highlight on it and

we'll call this painting finished i hope

you've enjoyed this one it's a nice

little painting could give you a lot of

happy little ideas from all of us here

happy painting god bless





- hello, i'm bob ross

and i'd like to welcome you to series 31

of the joy of painting.

if this is your first time with us,

allow me to extend a personal invitation

for you to drag out
your paints and brushes

and paint along with us each show.

and if you've been with us before,

please allow me to thank
you for inviting us

back for another series of painting shows.

tell you what, let's start right off today

and have them run all the
colors across the screen

that you need to paint along with us.

while they're doing that, let me show you

what i got done up here.

today i'm using an 18 by 24-inch canvas.

it's pre-stretched and double-primed.

and then i've just
covered the entire canvas

with a very thin coat of liquid white.

this is a wet-on-wet painting technique,

so the liquid white is there only

to make the canvas wet.

it allows us to actually blend
color right on the canvas,

rather than working ourself to death.

so let's do that.

tell you what, we'll start off today

with a little two-inch brush.

there we are, we'll take a
little touch of phthalo blue.

phthalo blue's a beautiful,
beautiful blue color.

just tap a little into the bristles.

we don't need a lot.

all right, let's go right up in here.

now we'll start just making little x's,

just little criss-cross
strokes, that easy.

that easy, and we'll work all
the way across the canvas.

now we start at the top and work down,

that way the paint is continually mixing

with the liquid white that's
already on the canvas.

and automatically, your sky will get

lighter and lighter as you
work down toward the horizon.

and in a landscape, that's exactly

what we're looking for.

there, let the canvas work for you.

allow the colors and the paint,

everything to work
together to make it easy.

this is a painting
technique that you can do.

there's no big secrets here.

people who've never painted do this

every day and it works for them.

all right, i think i'll have some water

in this painting today, i love water.

it's easy to paint and we'll just take,

we'll use that same old phthalo blue.

just add a little more onto the brush.

now still water is always level

and i think today, let's have still water.

so pull from the outside to in, like so.

that's all there is to it.

we'll go to the other side and do

the same, identical thing.

but i suggest you pull
from the outside in.

if you start here and go across,

it leaves a big line and
it's very hard to work out.

there, so pull from the outside in.

and it leaves a little area in here

that's sort of light, if everything works

just right, it'll look
like a sheen of light

just streaking right across your water.

sneaky, but it works great.

there we go.

now then, i wanna darken
the corners on this,

so i'm gonna take a little prussian blue.

prussian blue is much, much
stronger than phthalo blue.

it's a beautiful blue though, let's take

a little of that and
right up in the corners,

i'm just gonna add a small amount

of the prussian blue, like that.

now when the painting is completely done,

these dark corners will help lead the eye

toward the center of the painting.

there, that's really all there is to it.

and we'll put a little in the water too,

we don't want it left out.

just down at the bottom
and let it work upward.

there, shoot we're in business already.

thought today we would just do

a little mountain scene, it's
very pretty, very easy to do.

all right, now see even
though we're blending

across that, that little light area

still, it remains in there.

okay, we'll just blend that
color 'til it's nice and smooth.

and we're in business.

now comes the most fun part of

the whole technique and
that's washing the brush.

if you've painted with me before,

 you know this is
where i really have a good time

is cleaning this little brush.

we wash our brush with
odorless paint thinner,

shake it off, then .

then just beat the devil of it.

that really is the fun part
of this whole technique.

tell you what, today let's take,

we'll use a little bit of phthalo blue,

some alizarin crimson,
little bit of black.

i wanna make a little mountain in here.

and i wanna make a dark
lavender-looking color,

very dark, very, very dark.

maybe a little more crimson.

proportionately, much, much
more crimson than blue.

kay, let me wipe the ol' knife.

and we just wipe the
knife on a paper towel.

now it's most important
how you load the knife.

take, cut across the paint and get

a little roll that lives right
on the edge of the knife.

okay, let's go up in here.

tell you what, put a
little white with that

and i wanna make a distant mountain first,

little mountain that lives far away.

so i've added a little
white and maybe, yeah.

right in here, just decide where you think

this little mountain lives in your world.

and drop it in, painting
is a very individual thing.

we all see nature through different eyes.

and that's the way you should paint it.

there, all we're looking
for is a nice top edge.

we could care less what's
happening down below.

our brush is good and
dry and we'll grab it.

because the liquid white's on the canvas,

you can literally move color, see there?

if you were working on a dry canvas,

right now you'd be in agony city.

but because it's wet, it will move.

and your brush strokes will create

the illusion of highlights and shadows

right there in your mountain.

and that's about all i need.

that mountain's gonna be
far away, very distant.

now i go back to the solid dark color.

and, come right up in here.

let's go right up in here.

i want you to see how dark it is.

don't be afraid of it 'cause it's dark.

we're gonna put a few
little highlights on it,

but you decide where all the little

protrusions on your
mountain live, little bumps.

maybe, yeah, how about one right there?

but it's that easy and there is

no right or wrong here.

the only rule that we have here

is that painting should make you happy.

you should enjoy it, and if it does that,

then it's good, then it's good.

all right, i get letters from youngsters,

some of them in their nineties,

that tell me they never
believed they could paint

and they've tried this,
and it's worked for them.

that's what makes this all worthwhile

is to hear stories of success from

all over the country and you
can do it, you can do it.

there we go, now once
again, i'm gonna pull this.

one of the rules if
you're painting mountains,

always remember if you can
see the entire mountain,

it's always more distinct on the top

than it is on the bottom

'cause we have mist and now we have

wonderful pollution that sorta lays

around the bottom of the mountain

and it breaks up and diffuses the light,

so it looks softer.

there, now sometimes, tell you what,

let's get crazy today.

sometimes, sometimes, sometimes,

while i got that color going, it's fun

to take and reflect a
mountain right into the water.

now we're just looking for a
basic little reflection here.

we're not too worried
about it being exact.

in our world, we can do it
close enough, like that.

now sometimes, sometimes you may find,

when you first start, it's easier

to take the canvas off your easel

and turn it upside-down and just

basically re-paint the mountain.

if that works for you, that's okay,

any way that it works.

now, i'm gonna take, and just like we did,

i'm gonna pull that
color, just wanna pull it.

there, once again, the liquid white

allows you to move color on here.

that easy, that easy.

all right, see and that gives us

a basic reflection
there, may not be exact,

but it's close enough
for what we're doing.

all right, let me wash the brush.

wash the ol' brush, shake
off the excess there.



 i hit the bucket there.

there you go, just beat
the devil out of it.

all right, i usually run the brush

across a little paper
towel, just to make sure

it's as dry as i can possibly get it.

you don't wanna go up and touch

the canvas with a wet brush.

there, keep your canvas and your paint

as thick and firm as possible.

one of our golden rules is a thin paint

will stick to a thick paint, so you wanna

keep this as thick as possible.

i'm gonna take a little
white, a little black,

make just a touch of
gray, something like so.

little roll of paint again,
we'll always load the knife,

that little roll of paint.

i don't want very distinct things today,

just want the indication
of little things happening.

no pressure, absolutely no pressure.

just let it float right across there.

just wanna give some indications,

but not a lot of detail.

don't worry about it, just a little.

sometimes we put a lot of indications,

sometimes a few and it's
really and truly up to you.

you decide what's in your world.

there, see make this
little bump right there

and you can take a little of this,

give it a little pull, but i don't

want it to be real distinct,

just sort of a quiet little place there.

there, that easy, no
pressure on the knife.

i know i say that over
and over in the shows,

but it's probably the
single biggest mistake

people make when they first start

is applying too much
pressure on the knife.

then it looks just like
you were icing a cake.

and that's all right, but
it really looks better

if the paint sort of breaks and by break,

that just means it has holes in it.

and that's done by just a gentle pressure,

very, very gentle pressure.

all right, something about like that.

and we can sorta just rub it
a little bit, blend it out.

once again, i don't want a
lot of detail in this one,

clean, dry, brush, and
i'm gonna tap the base,

following the angles here.

always follow those angles and just

blend it a little bit,
just blend it, blend it.

bring it together, like so.

that's all there is to it.

all right, now then, tell you what,

we'll just take, that little
brush working pretty good.

we'll just take that same mountain color,

same old mountain color,
sort of a lavender.

we'll tap a little bit right
into that two-inch brush.

don't be afraid of this
brush 'cause it's large.

it'll do wonderful things.

now then, let's decide, yeah there we go.

maybe right in here
there's a little foothill,

lives right here, just a little footy hill

right at the base of the mountain.

just tap in the basic shape
that you want it to be.

maybe something about like that,

it doesn't matter, it's up to you.

there, see there, now very gently

grab it and lift up, tiny
little strokes though,

short little strokes and do it in layers.

it'll give the impression of distant trees

that live far away, they live right

at the base of this old mountain.

what a view they would have.

little touch of that color, and we can

go right in here and give the indication

of a little reflection of that, that easy.

now then let me get a clean brush.

i have several of each brush here.

i wanna create the
illusion of a reflection

on this, that we dropped in here.

normally we'd pull down,
this time, pull up.

and i'm beating the brush
just to remove excess color

'cause you're gonna pick up a little color

and that will remove it, see there?

all there is to it.

now, very lightly, go across

and that'll give the indication

of an instant reflection, that easy.

all right, now then, let's have some fun.

we'll take, we'll just use
that same mountain color,

so we had some blue and some black

and some crimson, i'll
put some brown in it

and some sap green, basically
all your dark colors.

some sap green, all right,
let me clean the ol' knife.

now then, let's grab
us a little fan brush.

there's one, number six fan brush.

take a little color, just put a little

bit of color right on the brush.

that's all there is to it, kay?

now maybe, let's see if that shows up,

might have to make it a little lighter

to get it to show, so we'll add

a little white, just a
little touch of white.

yeah, that's a little better.

now then i'm just gonna take and grab that

and lift upward, want it to look

like little trees, little closer to us,

but living very far away, very far away.

just touch it, all you're doing

is putting a little line of paint

and then you lift it upward,
could not be simpler.

there, there, that's all there is to it.

we'll take the knife, little bit

of dark sienna and van dyke brown,

mix it together, maybe
a little white with it.

there you go, that's a
nice color, i like that.

just sorta play around with color

'til you get what you want.

a little roll of paint and
let's go right up in here.

and with that, we'll
just put the indication,

maybe like, right there, see?

see, i'm sorry, i get excited.

i've painted like this for 20 years

and i still get excited
when i see it work.

so wonderful, i was a traditional painter

for many years and i now
call that my agony years

'cause i agonized over paintings.

little bit of liquid white and we'll

just cut in a little water line,

just a little tiny water line.

this is sort of a light area that

separates the two darks.

there, now if you put a little

too much liquid white on there,

and you think it's a little too strong,

just rub it, it will just
be absorbed into the color.

it'll go away, no problem at all.

there, all right, that gives us

a pretty nice little background.

let's see, we need to figure out

what we're gonna put
in here, so let's take,

let's take , crazy time,

we'll take some more of that.

we got some prussian blue, sap green,

crimson, brown, we'll mix up a pretty good

pile of paint here, let's play a little.

all right, here's ol' two-inch brush.

we'll take him, load a lot
of color into the brush.

and we have to sorta make
some decisions in our world.

let's just block in some areas.

now then, maybe in our world, we're

gonna have a big tree
that lives right here.

we're not looking for
a lot of detail here.

all we're doing is blocking
in some basic shape.

this is sort of your bravery test

after you've worked so hard to

put in all those gorgeous things.

then you come up here, some crazy,

fuzzy-haired guy says, "put a big tree

right over the top of it."

but that's all right, there.

we'll decide where that goes later.

maybe, we'll grab a little fan brush.

we'll have some more fun here.

take a fan brush, load it
full of that dark color.

maybe there's some little, maybe there's

a little peninsula right here, yeah.

when you paint, you begin to see things.

let them happen, just let them happen.

let them happen, don't worry about them.

learn to compose as you paint.

learn to take advantage of what happens.

we call those happy accidents

and they can be your best friend.

there, maybe, yeah, maybe it comes

right on down, right in there,

about like that.

we don't even know where
it goes over there,

don't think we care at this point.

all right, just wanna create a little mist

down here at the base and we can do that

with a clean brush, like so.

then lift slightly upward, sort of

brings everything together.

there, course right underneath that,

we'd need a reflection, we
would need a reflection,

so just pull it straight
down, straight down.

it's most important that
it goes straight down.

reflection should be as dark as

the object that's casting the reflection.

there, and then go across.

give us a little instant reflection.

now, maybe, tell you what, maybe

there's a tree that lives right here.

we'll put some highlight
on him so he'll show.

this one lives a little closer to us,

so we can make out a
little more detail on him.

there, just a, he's got a friend.

happy little tree, lives right here,

watches everything happen.

all right, now i'll go right into

a little touch of the
cadmium yellow, yellow ochre.

sooner or later, i'll hit all the yellows

and a little bit of the red.

i wanna make a nice green color

because you had blue
and black on your brush,

when you go in here,
you'll get green instantly.

now then, we can come right along in here

and place just a few little
highlights on this tree.

that'll snatch it right
out from that background.

little more color and we'll put a few

highlights on this little rascal.

maybe in our world here, maybe there's

a few little grassy things
that we're beginning to see,

don't want a lot of detail yet,

just a few little things far away.

little sparklers, there they go.

we don't know where they go over here,

don't know where they go.

take a little bit of our
brown and white we used.

and we can put the indication of

a little land mass here, see there?

that simple, little bit of land.

little touch of the liquid white

just to give the indication
of a water line right in here.

don't want a lot of color,

just a little here and there.

see how that works, it's neat, huh?

now then, we gotta decide
where this big tree lives.

here he comes, here he comes.

he comes right on down,
this is just dark color.

just a lot of dark color.

maybe, maybe he comes
all the way down here.

i don't know, that's the
beauty of painting like this.

you really don't have to know exactly

where everything's at, it just works.

little paint thinner, liner
brush, that brown color.

here and there and there and here,

we'll just put the
indication of a little limb,

little trunk lives in there.

don't have to worry about it very much.

let's take, we'll use some of that yellow,

greens, mix them on the
two-inch brush though.

let's go right in here and let's just

begin picking out some highlights.

there, just the corner of
the brush, all you're using.

there you are, now if you've got

a very thick, dry paint up on the canvas,

you can put this right on here.

it'll go right on the top
without mixing together.

but the paint on your brush has

to be a little bit thinner than

what you have on the canvas already.

it'll always pull toward
the thickest area.

there we are, now our yellows are made

just a little bit thinner,
so that works automatically.

there, maybe on down like that.

now i'm gonna change
the flavor a little bit,

add a little bright red,
a little yellow ochre.

maybe, yeah you're right, right there.

there's another little tree, bush,

whatever you wanna call it, wherever,

we're still just using
the corner of the brush.

that's really all there is to it.

and i'm gonna dip the brush into

a little touch of paint thinner,

wanna make it just a little thinner.

i'm gonna go over several
layers of paint here.

there, but if you add paint thinner,

add the smallest,
smallest amount possible.

you don't need much, don't need much.

tell you what let's do,
let's have some fun.

clean off a little spot to work here.

even with my palette this
big, i still run out of room.

we're gonna take black, brown,

mix them together.

now then, over here i'm gonna take

a little bit of white and
black to make a gray color.

there, something about like that.

kay, now, we're gonna take
and add paint thinner to this.

i want to make this very thin.

as we mentioned earlier, a thin paint

will stick to a thick paint.

so now, i wanna show you an easy way

of making a fantastic effect, but

we need to thin these colors.

but if we hadn't started with a very

thick, dry paint, this wouldn't work.

so be sure you, i hate to keep

talking about the paint,
but it is important.

i get so many letters from people

that say they're having problems and

when i begin to talk to them, the problem

usually evolves from starting
with paint that's very thin.

start with thick paint, then
each layer gets thinner.

today, let's use a little oval brush.

i'll go through the dark color,

through the dark color, both sides.

now one side, one side only,

i will put it in the light color.

so you got dark and light.

now watch, watch, you can make

the indication of little stones

all in one stroke, like that.

that easy, that easy.

now, pull a little
reflection down, like so.

come across, go back to our little brush

that has the grassy color on it.

put in a few little
highlights here and there,

just a few little duders.

now, back to this and maybe

there's a little, yep, little
stone lives right there

and wherever you want them,
you just drop them in,

several little stones, put
some little grassy things.

right around here, look at there,

see it brings it all together,

little yellow ochre in there too.

just brings it all together, makes it fit.

there we are, now this
little rascal out here,

pull down a little touch of reflection.

go across, take our small knife

and we'll put just the indication

of a little water line here and there,

sort of bring it all together,
just to bring it together.

shoot, i think we got a
finished painting here.

really hope you've enjoyed this

and hope you'll join us for the rest

of this television series
and from all of us here,

i'd like to wish you happy painting

and god bless, my friend.



- hello, glad to see you again.

today i thought we'd do
an almighty winter picture

and i want to put a great
of emphasis on the sky

and how we make big bellowy,
fluffy clouds that just

roll and lay up in the sky here.

so i've covered the
canvas with magic white

and i'm gonna start with
sort of a grey color here

made by mixing a little prussian blue,

a little brown and a little white

and we're just gonna
start gently working this

and let it go.

there we go, we just sort of
work it around and around here.

this is a winter sky.

bad weather's coming in.

okay, here we go.

now we just sorta bring all this together.

but we want this swirling
turning action here.

and then very lightly back in here.

okay.

now we'll take our fan brush
with a little bit of white

and we'll put just a touch of
permanent red with it here.

okay, a little bit of magic white.

now we're gonna start
way back in the back,

the cloud farthest away first.

and we'll start working this.

there we go.



and you keep this brush
moving all the time.

just let it dance and play
and have fun up through there.

very gently we'll blend that.

okay, now we're ready to start working it.

always doing the thing,
it's farthest away first

and working forward.

there.

then we'll hypnotize a
little bit, very gently,

we don't want to destroy
what we've worked so hard

to put in here, we just
wanna blend it together.

there.

today i'm using two fan brushes,

one so i can work with the darks

and the other one with the lights.

we'll throw some ol' grey clouds in here

that are sneaking around
and having fun too.

there he comes.

and maybe there's an old
grey one just sorta laying

out here like this.

and we'll work this one
just a little touch.

and we'll go back into another
little white cloud here.

and by the time i've got down
this low i'm getting away

from the pink that i had, i
just want the pink in the top

to give indication that
sunlight's playing through there.

then all these beautiful
clouds just happen

right up here in the sky.

clouds used to be something
that drove me crazy

when i was a traditional painter.

you'd work for days and days
to make big, fluffy clouds.

and here you just sorta let it
happen, don't worry about it.

don't try to plan 'em.

ah, there's another nice one.

'cause clouds are free.

they have no boundaries.

they come and go as they please.

okay, let's see.

really pushing that paint into the canvas,

you wanna grind the value
right into the materials.

while we're talking about canvas,

one of the things to look for

when you're buying a canvas
to paint this technique

is look for a canvas
that's acrylic primed.

that'll hold the magic
white on there longer.

keep it wet longer.

and we depend on this being
wet throughout the painting.

okay, maybe there's another
little fluffy right in here.

just wherever.

just let it happen, don't worry about it.

there we go.

and here we're just putting
some brush strokes in.

indicate light coming through there.

okay, maybe laying up here in the clouds

we have some little mountains
that are just laying in here.

okay, we want these to
blend right into nothing.

we're gonna lay these right in the clouds.

okay, we'll have a little light
playing down through here.

just bouncing around, having fun.

there.

right up to this peak.

want these to be far, far away

just about disappearing
right into the sky.

then we're gonna diffuse them

by just tap, tap, tapping right along,

always following the angles here.

just tapping.

and then we'll gently hypnotize them

so they just disappear right
on back into the picture.

okay.

now we can just lay clouds all around 'em.

just set 'em down in there.

we'll work those a little bit.

maybe a little touch of grey in here.

okay.

now when you're at home doing
this and have unlimited time,

you can put a great deal
more detail in here.

this is just to give you
an idea of how it's done.

okay.

let's have an almighty mountain.

let's come all the way
down, what the heck.

he just comes right up through here.

very little paint.

we're really pushing this
paint into the canvas.

okay, then we'll take, pull that down.

just makes the next layer
of paint stick better.

i'm gonna add just a little
touch of prussian blue here.

just so we have some
shadows under the snow.

okay.

now we can put some almighty snow

coming all the way down
through this mountain here.

and we're just gonna let it run and play.

just let it go.

there.

see how easy that is?

just let it flow in there.

and we'll run some right
along this mountain peak.

and maybe here since our
light's coming from here,

this one's gonna be highlighted
from the other side.

we'll create a little valley
maybe right down through there.

we can lay in some shadows
here using just some

prussian blue and white.

there we go.

any place you want a ridge to stand up,

all you have to do is lay
a shadow underneath it

and automatically it's right there.

some shadows running down behind this one.

okay.

now, with a clean dry brush
i'm gonna diffuse this,

lay it in this mist, i want
this to be misty in the back.

like it's very, very, very cold.

where i live, in fairbanks,
it's not unusual for it

to get 60 or 70 degrees below zero.

and it's always very, very misty.

we have ice fog that forms
and lays in between the trees.

it's cold but it's beautiful.

mmkay.

now, let's take here,

a little bit of the grey color

and i'm gonna lighten
it up just a little bit

with a little titanium white.

there, nice color.

load this brush full of paint

and we'll put a little tree
way back in the distance here.

and i thought today we'd
make these little trees

with the fan brush.

we can make them with a
fan brush, one inch brush,

two and a half inch brush.

today i thought we'd do it with this.

and you want these to be very quiet.

very subdued.

to give the illusion of distance.

okay, maybe there's
another one right there.

and we can start laying in a
little bit of snow up here.

and see how that color comes through

and we use that to make the shadow effect.

mmkay.

and as i say, i want to lay this in mist

so i'm just gonna gently tap this.

i want it to be far away and misty.

now we'll come forward just a little bit,

drop in some more little trees here.

there we go.

just go and forth with your fan brush

and you're sorta bending
these bristles downward.

and however many trees you want.

this is your world so

you can put as many
trees in it as you want.

but you notice, these
trees are a little darker

than the first ones we put in.

mmkay.

now, let's mist these
up just a little bit.

all i'm doing is just tapping.

then i'll lift it a little.

and maybe we got a few
little bushes growing

right around here that
just covered with snow.

okay.

so, we'll put some magic
white and some titanium white,

mix 'em together.

thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

then we'll just put these
little sparklers here,

just little snow covered bushes.

there we go.

and we'll put a few little sticks in here.

mmkay, let's move over to this side

and see what we can put in here.

trees are closer to you,

they're gonna be getting a little bigger.

there.

and you need to,

when you're making these
evergreen trees here,

you need to leave spots
open in between the limbs.

birds have got to have a place to sit

and wind's gotta get through.

don't kill all those.

get away from the little
christmas tree things

we used to make when
we were kids in school.

trees don't grow even,
they don't grow straight.

however makes them happy

according to the weather, the conditions,

the amount of heat or cold.

all these things effect
the way a tree looks.

okay.

maybe we want one right in the front.

i just made this a little
darker so he stands out.

a little baby tree right there.

see, because he's a
little darker now he shows

otherwise he wouldn't show.

he'd just lay in there and be quiet

and you'd never know he was there.

now we know he's there.

gonna tap this just gently.

okay.

and let's have this come down like this.

we'll just make another little thing

coming right down through here.

change the angle.

mmkay.

pull that right through.

this is a very cold picture,

i may have to go get my
coat here in a second,

it's about to freeze me to death.

there we go.

and as you can see,
where the paint breaks,

shadows automatically happen in the snow.

it's very rare that snow is pure white.

you always have the shadows
and you have some dirt

that shows through and
all those little things.

okay, we'll have some of those nice little

snow covered bushes on this side too.

don't want this side to get jealous.

okay, a little magic white,
a little plain white.

there we go.

nice little snow covered bushes.

maybe, if we had such a beautiful scene,

maybe we'd need a little cabin about here.

we have to have a little
hunter's cabin or something

right out through here.

so first i'll take and
scrape off the basic shape.

this gets rid of all this
loose paint, the thinner paint

so we'll have something to work on here.

and we'll take that off.

it's also a very good
way to lay in your cabin,

to work on a perspective and lay it out

exactly the way you want it.

and just a general shape.

the big thing is to get
the loose paint off.

okay, now we'll take a
little van dyke brown

and we'll back this back eave back here.

just like so, nice and dark.

there we go.

then we'll lay a roof on here.

there.

just a little bitty cabin
out here in the woods.

little snow on the other side.

maybe the snow's pretty thick
so we'll lay it on there

nice and thick so it looks strong.

then we'll put the front on.

mmkay.

son of a gun, there he comes.

mmkay, let's make this an old cabin.

so we'll just make it
weather beaten, old boards.

lay some shadows on top of that.

this is van dyke brown again,

i'm just sort of
alternating back and forth

between brown and white to
make it look very, very old.

this old hunter he...

he went out after moose, it was too big

and he ran off with him.

so the old cabin's just
standing here abandoned.

better put a door on it though.

maybe a passing hunter would
like to stay here overnight.

there we go.

and we'll make this an old slab cabin.

we'll just put some boards right in there.

mmkay.

and you can, if you wanna
push this back a little bit,

we can put a darker color on here first.

we'll just push this cabin right back into

the bushes a little bit and
we'll have some little bushes

growing right down like that.

little big of magic.

okay.

maybe when this old fella lived here,

maybe he had a little fence that ran back.

he might've had an animal
or two he kept in here

so let's just put a little fence.

and this little fence is
running over the hill.

we'll just let it go right
on back over the hill.

just see the top of that one.

and a little bit of highlight.

then a little bit of
snow on top of the posts.

there we go.

okay, then we can run
some wire right down this

and let it disappear right over the hill.

like so.

okay, maybe a couple little
bushes out here in the front.

and i think we need some icicles.

so we'll use just straight magic white

and we'll pull down some
little icicles here.

using the liner brush, this
is a number two script liner.

whew, it's getting colder already.

mmkay.

let's move out the snow a little.

and let's put a few more
little sticks here and there.

mmkay.

this is truly an almighty mountain.

there we go, few little
sticks here and there.

maybe here and there
are little indications.

mmkay.

just here and there,
we don't wanna overdo.

we want this to look
very soft, very misty,

far, far away.

mmkay.

take a little thin oil here.

and we'll just sign this
happy little picture.

and i hope in the last 30
minutes we have shown you

something that you can do very quickly.

a way to make some almighty
clouds, almighty mountains.

some fantastic things using
very, very limited pallet.

we've used mostly blue, brown
and white in this picture;

almost nothing else at all.

but it's a very effective picture

and it has a tremendous sky.

you can work on this sky.

once again, you have
unlimited time at home.

you can take this sky to points

that are almost unbelievable.

you can work it, you can
alternate between darks and lights

in the sky.

you can make skies that almost
look like religious skies,

that things are gonna come through.

practice it, work with
it, don't give up on it.

all you need is a dream in here
that you wanna put on there.

and we thank you very, very
much for being with us today.

once again, if you have
questions, if you have comments,

feel free to drop us a line.

we'll be glad to answer
any question that we can.

from all of us here, happy painting.

thank you very, very much for watching.



- hi, welcome back.

certainly glad you could join me today.

you know, we get hundreds and hundreds

of letters here concerning
the joy of painting.

and one of the things we
here over and over again

is people feel intimidated,
or they're a little nervous

about putting the first stroke on canvas.

so, i thought we'd devote
this entire show today

to teaching you how to
just sort of loosen up,

and take life easy, and enjoy painting.

we're gonna use a very limited palette,

and maybe i'll just use
something like a two inch brush

and maybe a palette knife.

very simple, but i wanna
show you how to get

over this fear of your first painting.

so, let's have them run the colors

that i'm gonna use across the screen.

and let's just have some fun today.

just drag out the old easy chair,

and get you a big glass of iced tea,

and kick back, and sort of enjoy this.

if you have your paintbrush out,

i invite you to paint along with us,

and i think you'll enjoy doing something

that's a little different.

it's very free, very
relaxed, and it gets you over

this tightness, or this
fear of your first painting.

so, i'm just putting a little
liquid white on the canvas.

and basically here, all we're
looking for is just a nice

thin even coat, of the liquid
medium all the way across

the canvas.

this just makes the canvas wet and slick.

it's what allows color to blend on here,

and maybe we can really demonstrate today

how color blends on this liquid white.

now, this is a pre-stretched canvas.

it has give to it.

it's not a canvas board,

we don't recommend those.

because they have cardboard in the center,

and what happens, they'll
absorb this liquid white,

and very rapidly your
surface will become dry.

and it's no fun to paint on it anymore.

because this is wet you
need it to stay that way.

all right, let's take
a little yellow ochre,

and i'm just gonna play today.

let's just have fun.

a little yellow ochre.

be right back, don't go away.

little touch of the black into it.

very little.

and we just make a light
little color, like so.

and we still have liquid
white on the brush.

so, we're just letting that blend.

we're gonna make a very soft,

maybe a little muted
area in the background

back here.

and just play with color.

you know, maybe one of the hardest things

to do in painting is to

is to get over this fear of canvas.

it's natural.

and if it bothers you a
little bit to jump up here

and start throwing a bunch
of color on the canvas,

it means you're normal.

you're just like me and everybody
else that's every painted.

you go through this until
you get over this fear.

so, that's what we wanna

we wanna play with.

then, we'll take a little
touch of the prussian blue.

so, this begins to get a
slight greenish hue to it,

but not much,

not much.

and let's just begin playing with color.

just play, maybe we ought
to decide what season

it's gonna be, at least,
before we get too far involved.

and maybe something in the winter colors

that's always fun.

a little bit more of the prussian blue,

and black.

a little touch of yellow ochre,

but mostly just blue and black.

and just let these colors
sort of blend together

and play, and have fun.

but really and truly don't worry about it.

the way to learn how to paint

is to be relaxed and
enjoy, and just let it go.

things work better for
you when you're relaxed,

and you're really happy
with what you're doing.

so, try to let it happen that way.

maybe on this side, we'll
put a little bit more of that

there.

see, we just sort of let these
colors come together here,

like so.

but very loose.

very loose.

there.

okay.

and we let them go wherever.

doesn't matter.

there we are.

but see, that easy.

you have a very nice little sky.

one of the best ways to do this,

nearly every time you do a painting

you're gonna have a
bunch of color left over.

this is a super, super way
of using up that old color,

and enjoying the freedom of just painting.

and just letting your
imagination run wild with you.

so, try this.

i'm serious, there's
nothing that i know of that

will teach you looseness more than this.

i want to make this side over
here a little bit darker.

see, and as you begin painting,
you begin seeing things.

all these little things
just sort of happen.

so now automatically we have a light area

over in here.

just because we made these
sides a little darker.

i'll make it even a little
darker yet, what the heck.

this is our world, so we can do it any way

that we want.

we'll just make a little
cross criss strokes.

we'll do it backwards today.

there.

and very lightly, i'll just
sort of blend that out a little.

and we have all kinds of
things happening in this sky.

that simple.

and if you wanna blend it more,

just continue to blend.

you can make it as soft as silk or velvet,

just by doing that.

and maybe in our world,

maybe way back here in the background

maybe we can visualize
some little distant tree

indication.

just take the brush, lay it like that,

give it a little gentle push.

but i want these to be very soft,

and very light.

far away.

see?

now, the other side.

these are just little indications
of things that are far

back here in the distance.

far away.

don't let them get too distinct.

or you'll ruin that illusion
of distance in your painting.

and we're just gonna play here.

enjoy this.

let it go.

let it happen.

let it happen.

maybe there's another one right there.

i don't know.

wherever you wanna.

but this is mainly a
little midnight black,

a little prussian blue,

and there's a touch of
yellow ochre left in it.

you can add maybe the least
little touch of van dyke brown,

but the color should be
very soft and very muted

at this point.

very soft and quiet.

maybe this one goes way up here.

we don't know.

just push harder if you
want it to look like

it's a bigger tree.

but this background idea is a way

to make very soft scenes that

you wanna show a lot of distance in.

and it's a very, very simple and effective

okay, a little more of
the color on the brush.

tell you what, maybe there's
a tree that lives right here.

maybe this one, maybe this
one is sort of crooked.

and it goes all the way off the canvas.

who cares?

in your world, you can make
it any way that you want it.

these are just, once
again, distant indications

of things that are happening.

very soft and muted, quiet

peaceful little places.

this is where all the little
creatures live and have fun.

there.

some of them you can hardly see in there.

they're so far away.

there, maybe.

there we are.

let's see, we said this
was going to be winter.

so, we need to keep that in mind.

i'll mess around here,
and forget what season

i said it was gonna be.

there we go.

now then, down here at the base

we're still using the same colors.

the same ol' colors.

we can tap in a few little happy bushes

that live right down in here.

this is just a tiny bit darker.

so, it indicates that
it's a little closer.

now, if this is our light source here

less pressure on the brush.

let it get lighter, and lighter.

very gentle.

just sort of fade right into that.

where you want it to be darker,

just get a little tougher.

push,

and let it go right off there somewhere.

there we go.

maybe over in here

tell you what, maybe

maybe there's a few little trees that,

yep you're right,

live right here.

just little indications of little things.

see, and you can just turn the
brush in different directions

to create all types of effects.

there.

and just sort of look at it once again.

this is such a fantastic way of painting

because you have no

you don't trace a painting up here,

and you don't have any guidelines.

the only thing that restricts
you here is your imagination.

just your imagination, nothing else.

and imagination is like anything else,

it's like a muscle in your body,

if you practice with it, you
exercise your imagination

it gets stronger.

very soon, you're able to
visualize more and more things

in your mind.

so, use it.

god gave you this gift.

take advantage of it.

we may be the only creature on earth that

has a vivid imagination.

there.

then again, we may not.

i don't know.

don't know that it matters.

there.

and we'll start adding

mmm, we'll take a little more
of the black, and the blue,

van dyke brown, maybe a little
tough of the dark sienna

here and there.

but as we work forward, i
want this color to begin

getting a little darker.

and see, i'm just loading the brush

by just going back and forth.

doesn't matter how you load it.

doesn't matter.

there, a little blue, and
black, a little van dyke brown.

all those beautiful, beautiful colors.

now, then maybe

watch here.

see, all you gotta do is take
this brush and push upward,

like that to make.

look at that.

see, that easy you can
make the illusion of little

grassy areas back in here.

just like so.

shoot, maybe we'll have some over here.

and we're gonna sort of
change the lay of the land

here a little.

so, it has some interesting
things happening in here,

it's not just all the same.

let these little things just happen.

there.

all kinds of little doers.

maybe over in here again.

see, you begin seeing these little doers.

but just pushing upward,

bend the brush very hard.

you're not gonna hurt the brush.

but it makes all these little
grassy looking effects.

they're very simple, and you can do them.

i know you can do them.

'cause you can do anything
that you wanna do.

as long as you can believe you can do it.

anything that you believe you can do,

you really can do.

let's take a two inch brush.

and i have several two inch brushes,

so i don't have to spend
all of my time here

just washing brushes.

just gonna pull through a little
bit of that titanium white.

this is gonna be winter, maybe.

maybe in our world there's a
little snow laying back here.

but i want the snow to
reflect some shadows

from whatever it is we have in here.

so, go up into the color
a little, and grab it,

and begin pulling.

now, watch here, let's
just mess something up.

if you mess up the top of this one,

don't worry about it.

you can either completely wipe it out,

or you can go back and
very simply drop it in.

'cause you know, if you've
painted with me before,

we don't make mistakes,

we have happy accidents.

because there's nothing that
you can do on this canvas

that with a little practice you can't fix.

think about the lay of the land now.

watch here.

let me grab this other old brush.

you can go right back in here.

see here?

and pop that right back in.

and that's nice because
now it looks like there's

snow behind it.

see?

these little things work for you.

see you could put one over here

like that.

see, and it looks like
there's snow back in there.

there, and you can make
this just as smooth

and peaceful.

maybe, we'll grab that.

see, we got quite of bit of color there.

that's nice, that'll make
a very nice shadow area.

there, and just sort of bring it together.

this old two inch brush will just do

wonderful things for you.

just fantastic things.

now, already though look
at the depth in here.

and you've really done nothing.

you've really done nothing except just

take a two inch brush and play a little.

let's take that same color we're using,

take a little paint
thinner on the liner brush.

maybe we'll have a few little
sticks and twigs in there.

maybe a few.

just pull this out.

turn it, so it brings it to
a very sharp point, okay.

now, we want these to be
very subdued and quiet.

we don't want these to be too bright.

too strong.

very subdued.

there, a few little things
that live back in here.

ooo, that's what i'm looking for.

you almost can't see
them, but they're there.

they're there, you'll see them.

there.

see?

and just pick out where you
think a little twig would live,

and drop it in,

drop it in.

so, now i mentioned we get
a lot of letters from people

who are a little nervous about
trying their first painting.

we also get a lot of letters
from people who are painting,

and they're doing some
of the most fantastic

things imaginable.

maybe in this series we'll show you some.

but people who have never painted,

just from watching the
show have picked up a brush

and they're doing marvelous things.

and maybe more important
than the painting,

is the fact that they can do it.

is the fact that you can
achieve a creative process

like this.

and it's a nice way of

oh, i think everybody has sort
of an urge to be creative,

and it's a nice way of
letting that urge come out

and it's so enjoyable.

that's one of the reasons
we like to show you.

shoot, let's get crazy i
talk too much sometime.

let's go back into some
of our blue, and black,

get a little brown, be right back here.

well, see i'm gonna have
a little more brown,

a little dark sienna.

i may even reach over here
and get the least little

touch of alizarin crimson.

oh nice, nice.

now, if your color gets too dark on you,

or you think it's too dark,

you can reach right over
pick up a little white,

and lighten it up.

because you can do anything.

let's load the brush up.

tell you what, let's
load it to a chisel edge.

let's really have some fun.

chisel edge, turn it
around here so you can see

how sharp that is.

see, it comes to a
beautiful sharp chisel edge.

there we go.

but you must put enough
paint into the bristles

to stick the bristles together
to make the chisel edge.

let's go back up here.

maybe in our world there
lives a little tree,

or a big tree.

maybe this is a big tree.

and we can, if it helps, you
can put in a little center line

like that.

get a little more color here.

now then, think about
where you would have nice

branches living here.

just take the corner of the brush,

and just put out a branch here and there.

just let them go.

just let them go.

and maybe they aren't all just even.

maybe these aren't all
potential christmas trees.

they're just trees that grew any way that

they wanted to grow.

all evergreen trees are not
gonna be christmas tress,

some of them's gonna be crooked,

some of them's gonna be sort of,

they gonna be sort of poor.

there.

a little more paint.

now, just to have a general
idea of where we're going,

and let's just take the corner
of the brush, once again.

there.

just tap in some very basic little shapes.

there we go.

maybe even we can see a little
touch of the trunk here.

who cares?

this is your world, you do it
any way that you wanna do it.

so, maybe this tree had
a bad year right in here.

it didn't grow too hot.

maybe when he was little

maybe some hungry creature decided to chew

on him a little bit.

we don't know.

don't know that we even care.

okay, now as the trees come closer,

they should get a little darker.

so, i'm gonna add a little bit
more of that prussian blue,

and a little van dyke brown, dark sienna.

but they begin taking on a darker tone.

black, blue, brown.

there we are.

sounds like my body condition
when i stay out too late.

black, blue, and brown, that's
what i get when i get home.

there we go.

maybe in our world there
lives another little tree,

right there.

okay.

we'll just let these little
trees just fall right

off the brush.

wherever,

wherever.

doesn't matter.

black, blue, and brown.

this one goes all the way off the canvas.

what the heck.

he's a strong tall tree.

but if you practice this
painting very loose.

you will not believe, number one,

what you can do.

secondly, it'll create a
looseness, and a freedom

in your painting that you've
never experienced before.

and i think you will find
that's very refreshing.

very, very, refreshing in your painting.

i have a lot of people who
have painted for many years

that take classes with
me, and my son steve,

and the other teachers that we have,

and they take classes
in this technique mainly

to learn to be loose with their painting.

because it's very easy
to get tight, and stiff,

and used to staying in the lines,

and just drawing little pictures,

and following those.

this will give you freedom.

absolute freedom.

there, let's go to the other side here.

little blue, black, back
to our brown, dark sienna,

just mix them together.

there, wiggle that brush though

that brings the paint right up to the end.

we need to make it sharp.

all right.

maybe look at what a
sharp line that is now.

see how sharp you can make that line?

now then, just the corner of the brush.

let's put in some little
things here and there.

see that?

you can do this.

you really can do this.

there.

let's give him a friend.

you know me.

i think everything, and everybody

should have a friend.

friends may be the most
valuable commodities

that we have.

treasure them, take care
of them, treat them good.

there we are.

now maybe, look just push upward.

see?

maybe there's a whole
'nother thing that comes

right out like that.

just by pushing up with the brush,

you can create that illusion.

just by giving a little upward push.

let's go back to the brush that has some

white on it.

and with that, let's come back in here,

and we lay in a little snow.

once again, pick up some
of this color though,

and drag it out there.

get tough with it.

because the canvas is wet,
you can move this color.

if this was a dry canvas,
you might be able to move it,

but it would be very difficult
and you'd work yourself

half to death trying to do it.

there we go.

maybe on this side, once again though,

figure out how the lay
of the land is here.

how the

how it flows.

and it's sort of nice to
have a little recessed area

right in here.

it just gives you a nice
place for the animals to walk,

and just good things to happen.

but any of these little
bushes and stuff here that

you don't like, you
just lay snow over them.

just like nature does.

so there.

look at that.

now then, we can take
some of that same color

on our knife and here and there,

if you wanted to, you
could add the indication

of a little stronger trunk.

depends on what you're looking for.

once again, very loose,

very relaxed.

just let it go.

this is fun painting.

there.

you know, this would be a super place

to have a little cabin.

let's do that.

i think we have enough time.

and a lot of people have
problems with a cabin,

so let me show you.

let's go right up in here.

decide where your cabin lives,

and let's just scrape out
a very basic little shape.

maybe we'll have a big cabin in here,

it shows up better.

see, just take the knife and
scrape out your basic shape.

now, right there's where there
is where the stretcher bar

is don't worry about
that, we'll cover that up.

now, one of the things
that you're looking for

when you're doing a cabin
is your perspective.

if you're gonna have a cabin, like so,

one of the most important
things you can do

is have this part of the
roof a little bit higher

than the back.

otherwise, it won't look right.

try to keep that a little bit higher.

if you put that a little lower,

which is almost a natural tendency,

it'll look like your cabin is sort of

well maybe the front of
it fell down into a hole.

i live in florida, and sometimes there's,

we have sinkholes there.

and it almost looks like your
cabin fell into a sinkhole.

see there, all right.

let's just put a little

we'll just dark sienna,
and van dyke brown,

mostly van dyke brown.

and let's just lay in.

all i'm doing is laying in some color now.

just laying in some color.

there.

you could do this with a cement
trowel, it doesn't matter.

a little something like that.

see, and the bottom at this point

don't be concerned with.

because you can come along
here with your knife,

and do a cabin-ectomy,
and decide exactly where

everything should live.

that easy.

and maybe, we said this
was gonna be a log cabin,

or something that gives you
the impression of a log cabin.

so, we'll take a little brown, and white,

and let's just come along in here.

and think about this angle right here.

and let's just tap in
some little indications

here and there.

see there.

all right.

okay, just drop it in.

there.

we can take that dark color
that we picked up earlier,

and go back,

and help create that illusion.

there.

over in here, this is gonna
be very dark on this side.

we don't want much color over here.

think i'll put a tree
there, what the heck.

put the indication of the end of the logs.

just using the point of the knife.

that easy.

maybe we got a door in here,
let's put a little door.

we gotta have a way to get in and out.

that's all there is to it.

put in a little door.

a little light around the door.

now, we need a little

let's put a little snow
up here on the roof.

see there.

but just pull it down.

just pull down.

we said we'd have a tree in front of it,

so we don't have to
worry much about the back

of it at this point.

we do need a little bit
of snow over on this side.

just so there's snow on both sides.

now then, let me go back to my brush here.

let's take, watch how
you can move the trees,

let's take some of our
brown, and black, and blue,

a little dark sienna.

okay, and let's go back up here.

now maybe, let's take
this tree right here,

right here,

and let's make a big decision.

this tree lives on this side of the cabin.

see, how you can change your mind?

you can pull this tree right over here

in front.

that easy.

that easy.

on this canvas, you have unlimited power.

now then, maybe

see there a little
grass growing over here.

maybe a little right in here.

whatever.

let's take our brush with the white on it,

come right up to the bottom of the cabin.

there we go.

put a little snow right in there.

watch here, watch here, watch here,

touch, push.

bend, bend the bristles.

just do this in layers.

continually in layers though.

grab the bottom,

give it a little pull.

like that.

see how that just all comes together?

shoot, tell you what maybe,
maybe there's a little sprig

right here.

and that way it looks like
there's stuff behind it.

there.

shoot, i'll tell you what,
let's go on the other side

over here.

maybe over here, in our world there lives,

well there does now,

maybe there's a little doer
that lives right out here.

now then, once again, take
a little titanium white,

grab that, and just let it flow.

see there?

that easy.

maybe...

see, how you can break that up,

and it creates the
illusion of depth in there.

shoot, we messed around here,
and about have a painting

that's not half bad.

and i was just going to
show you how to relax,

and enjoy this.

but i really hope you
try something like this,

because it's a great deal of fun.

it teaches you how to use the equipment,

it gives you confidence with equipment.

and once you have the confidence,

then you can do anything.

you can do anything.

we'll put a few little
sticks, here and there.

there's one.

and you can just go
around it, here and there,

and tap in a few,

like that.

that's really all there is to it.

wherever you think they should be.

and i think we'll call this finished.

i really hope you've
enjoyed this experiment,

and i hope you try it.

let me hear from you.

from all of us here,

happy painting,

and god bless.



hey i'm really really glad you could

join me today today is a very special

day to me and i'd like to share that

special day with you today marks a sort

of an anniversary for us where this

painting we will have one hundred joy of

painting shows isn't it fantastic it's

it's almost unbelievable to me then we

have a hundred shows now and i owe it to

you because you've allowed me into your

home each week you've called your pbs

station you've wrote letters you've made

it possible and i'd like to tell you

thank you and i hope you enjoy this

painting so let's go on up and let's get

started

let's say today we'll have them run all

the colors across the screen that you

need to do the painting starting with

the white and working around and that'll

tell you everything that you need to

paint this beautiful painting let's talk

a little bit as i have done on one of

the earlier shows i've taken and covered

the canvas with contact paper this is

just ordinary contact paper you can buy

at your local hardware store or

supermarket whatever and i've just cut a

design out here now in all honesty this

design came from a placemat off my table

so anything you can find to make a

nice-looking design you can use it and

then i've covered the outside of the

canvas with a contact paper and we're

ready to go and on that we'll do a

pretty little painting so let's get

started i'm going to take off with a

small amount a cadmium yellow just the

least little touch least little touch

will do a bright shiny pictures go right

in here and i'll just go across just

like it yes like so without cleaning the

brush i'm going right into a little bit

of yellow ochre same old dirty brush and

just lay a little touch so it blends

right into that like

here once again without cleaning the

brush i'm going into a little bit of the

bright-red

little bit it's very very strong and not

just put a little layer red right across

there okay it's sort of just very gently

very gently blend all those together you

don't want to look like stripes just

flame it together all righty now then

then i'm going to take a fan brush and

go right into a little touch of the

midnight black just a little bit just go

up here and up in here i'm going to

bounce in some happy little happy little

cloud shapes just let that brush plating

just work right down into the red keep

the brush moving little circles little

tiny circles just let it go every which

way here and there okay

you know wash that little brush just a

little bit of paint thinner and very

gently just gonna blend that black right

here on the bottom sort of blend it all

together now then under the black i'm

gonna go into the dark sienna same old

fan brush okay let's go back up here and

just put in a little bit of this

beautiful beautiful brown color and let

it play around

i can't

just sort of warms up the sky and i have

several fan brushes going so i don't

have to spend a lot of time washing

brushes so i'll take some red and

titanium white just to make a nice pink

color with that let's go right up here

and we just bounce in some happy little

cloud shapes just little tiny tiny

circles ke from going keep them going

and i did pick up some of that under

color so it all mixes together there

some of the browns and a little bit of a

black now with a clean dry brush very

gently very gently just blend all this

together you don't want to kill all the

little clouds now these dark colors

underneath here well absolutely

eat up your light colors so be very

careful don't want to eat them all up

you can make a fantastic little sky that

easy

very gentle hero3 hairs and some air and

you can beat the brush in that that

removes the excess paint you don't have

to go through all the cleaning

procedures look at there now just gently

blend it and you have an all-night esky

all righty

we got us a little sky let me wash this

brush as you know we wash the brushes

with odorless tanner shake them off and

just beat the devil out of them

alright let's get the old round brush

i'm go right into some van dyck brown

some of the dark sienna maybe a touch of

the sap green in there too just a little

bit let's drop in some some happy little

tree shapes and we're gonna put in some

little background trees just tapping

just happy you know as i said at the

beginning of the show this is a very

very special show to me because it marks


we know as of the filming of this show

that's gosh i said most painting shows

any series has ever had that's unreal

and there's been a lot of fantastic

people that have helped to make all of

this possible a lot of fantastic people

and i would like to i'd like to dedicate

this painting to a couple of people that

have really made the joy of painting

possible there's been several but i'd

really like to to mention by name first

of all uh my wife jane she's stood

behind listen and kept his thing going

and takes a special lady to live with a

crazy man and two other people that have

really really been super my business

partners and closest friends walt pinet

kowalski without them there would have

been no joy of painting and would like

to publicly say thank you very much

let's take a little brown here this is

the dark sienna van dyke and let's begin

putting in some happy little things

right along here this is where we begin

creating little lay of the land back in

there see how easy that is

hey hey be right over here all this dark

is is just just to give us a base color

so the light will show we put it on top

there we go

all right all right i'm gonna take the

liner brush a little bit of paint

thinner on it make that paint a stain is

water turn that brush pull it ends and

let's put some let's put a few

indications of some little tree trunks

we back we back in the distance there's

one before he just came right up above

the trees see there kitty and you can

put as many or as few as you want in

your painting there we go

start all over yeah let's start putting

some highlights on there i'll just go

back into this little round brush same

old dirty brush i haven't cleaned it

will tap in some yellows i'll grab a

little green sap green and we just tap

it in i got some yellow ochre cad yellow

little indian yellow okay let's go up

here just using the very top corner of

the brush just put in some happy little

shapes don't kill all your dark areas

don't kill them all look at that see if

you put too much detail then it's gonna

look too close and we want this to look

like it's far far away and very quiet

soft there i had a little bit of the

bright red to that keller oh look at

there there's a nice one nice one

okay

right there oh cans of things and work

in layers layer after layer after layer

that's what agreed to depth in your

painting okay now we can come down here

put in a little more of the dark and we

can start putting into highlights as i

say this is where you really begin

figuring out the lay of the lamp so

let's begin dropping it like so okay

once we have this dark here either

then we're ready so same whole dirty

brush i'm gonna go right into some of

the yellows and tap it see just tap it

okay let's go right up here now then

just begin touching

very gentle like so and you can make

layer after layer after layer what

you're doing this if you had trouble

getting your paint a stick add a little

bit of the liquid white or a small

amount of paint thinner just to make

your pain a little dinner i added a

touch of the bright red there just get

it to stand out a little see you can

just make layer after layer nice and

right there we go anywhere you want to

he'll just put a little bright area and

it creates the illusion of a a happy

little hillock there well just i don't

know go in there and let it work right

on up and just let your imagination go

when you're doing these at home the open

here we'll just pull that across we'll

come back and play with that later watch

you now we'll take a fan brush and very

gently with a fan brush let's make the

indication of just just a happy little

path that lives right up here all you're

doing is grabbing a little bit that

color i'm just pulling it if you want to

you here and there you can add a little

bit of brown just to make it look more

like dirt but allow it to grab these

colors just glitter i don't know

you got a little path that easy my head

with a touch of titanium point there

just to make it look like there's a

little sun playing through there just a

little sunshine okay we can take the

knife and just scratch into indication

of a few little trunks back in these

distant trees the background trees just

hearing there now then let's me find my

fan brush we'll go into some brown and

some of the midnight black let's build a

little tree let's have some fun a lot of

paint on the brush let's go right up

here maybe their lives right here right

here just a happy little evergreen tree

all i'm doing is just just barely

touching the canvas and i take the

corner of the brush and give it a little

upward push see give it a little huh

we'll put some little blooms out here on

him just like so make his trunk nice and

strong give him a little foots he's got

to have something to stand on something

to stand on okay maybe he's got a friend

that lives yep right there right there

his friends a little bigger a little

stronger maybe he's got two friends just

like yeah

now then on these they're a little

closer so you'd see a little more detail

i'm gonna take a little white on another

fan brush and just very gently very

gently come along this edge and put a

little bit of highlight just to make

them stand out a little better and you

can take your script liner brush a

little bit of the liquid black and put a

little film here and there see there

just a couple happy little limbs in fact

earth two inch brush and just sort of

blend his little foots right into the

right into the little grassy areas that

easy factor black brown mixture let's go

up here maybe yeah there we are it's a

happy little leaf little limbs little

leaves on these trees just live right

about there

i can't and then same will brush i'll go

right into a little bit of yellow

cuz there's black on there when you hit

that yellow it's gonna turn a beautiful

green color loaded full let's go back up

here now you can come back and just put

some highlights to want to cover all the

dark maybe i'll make it a little bit

brighter so you can see it a little more

that yep there it shows up a little

better for you see they're nice leaves

there and maybe there's even a few

shining on this one back here he's

father well you're not gonna see as much

detail on that one alright i think we're

i think we're coming right along here

brad now then let's have some fun let's

bring the camera right up close here

this is where the fun starts they grab

this contact paper

take this off look at that look at that

isn't that fantastic see it already you

have all you nice borders and around

here and what's really fun when you're

doing this at home you might want to

paint this oh like a nice tan color or a

very light like chalk powder blue you

can do all kinds of things so it looks

like borders looks like it's matted

around there when you get all finished i

get i get excited about these there are

a lot of fun okay go right into some

alizarin crimson a little bit of the

phthalo blue proportionately much more

crimson and the blue much more crimson

just tap that big brush in round brush

now here we go this is what's fun to me

i like to come out of these borders that

we created and let the painting actually

extend right out of the borders and all

we're doing here is just tapping in some

very basic little shapes where you want

some happy little things to be just like

so see and we're totally killing this

border okay now then i'll just use the

same will brush we'll go right into some

van dyck brown dark sienna and we'll put

another little tree there's right here

just all kinds of little trees see how

those little things happen maybe there's

a heavy bush it goes right here

these are really fun paintings i hope

you try some of them they're so so

effective that comes right on down

wherever you want it to go wherever over

here not much color that it like a

vignette just let it get softer and

softer and softer over here toward the

edges there we go all right now then

we'll take a liner brush let's put some

paint thinner on it and go right into

our brown turn that brush bring it to a

nice sure point okay now then let's go

right up in here and here some nice tree

limbs let's set them true right out onto

the pure white canvas see there look at

him just here and there just here

wherever there is something we over

there look at there you can just make

all kinds of happy little eels this is

just brown with paint thinner so it

flows there we go

but you have to make big decisions here

how many limbs live in your painting

just however many you want that's all

okay i may be down here just to change

things a little bit maybe maybe this

tree has a white trunk so i'll just use

a little bit of the liquid white and

we'll put a little white trunk in there

is that easy i like to turn that brush

it picks up all those under colors and

makes beautiful little effects say there

see how that stands out though if you

put dark against dark you wouldn't have

a whole bunch but when you put this

light against the dark

oh they stand out and shine for you

there maybe there's a little one right

here however many you want that's up to

you now we can have some fun let's take

the old two-inch brush and we'll go

right into some color here this is

yellow and green and i'm just tapping it

like so okay let's go up here now then

right along in here just barely touching

the canvas just put in a happy little

leaf here there and let some of them

extend out over your dark under color

that helps create the illusion of a of a

vignette see there

no these paintings really excite me this

is this is reason i chose to do this

type of painting on such a special day

i'm really glad you joined me for this

status as i say dee you just can't

believe how special this is for me and

you've made it possible there there we

go

now let's put some let's put some things

in here i'll go back to the round brush

it's a lot of fun i'm just tapping into

a little yellow ochre and little green

reach over here get a touch of the

bright red just a touch

it's very strong very strong just go up

here now then just using the top corner

just the very top god just tap in all

kinds a little leafy effects after paint

won't stick i've set it over and over

add a little bit of liquid white or a

little bit of thinner let him just come

right on because a thin paint will stick

to a thick paint then the thick it's

probably our golden rule signal illest

project right on out past the dark

there's another happy little bush that's

right there see i knew he was there you

did too didn't he you knew he was there

there we go there's another little bush

he lives right there okay coming right

on forward oh there's one he's looks

like he's got little flowers on him

happy blush it's only kind of bushes we

make they're always happy and we'll just

sort of let some little things just just

graduate out into here just let the

color just sort of disappear gentle

gentle light little touch see there

these are very soft little paintings

these make excellent gifts for all your

friends people really love these and

when you frame them oh you can't believe

how pretty they are can't believe and

your friends will say you didn't paint

that but you know you did and you can

you can do it take just that klein point

of knife and scrape down a few little

sticks and trunk indications here and

there

just like so oh right you know me i'm

not happy when we paint unless we have a

big tree in there so let's put a big

tree i don't go right into the midnight

black and the van dyck brown

lololololololololol just be happy mix up

all these colors look at all the paint

nut brush let's go up here i said i

wanted a big tree so let's do a penguin

i think my big tree lives don't yell at

me don't yell at me he lives right there

there he comes oh goodness

big ol tree he goes right off the canvas

strong tree big tree look at that

be brave hey right maybe he's got a big

foot it comes right down here i can't

make old foot all right now i've got

another fan brush and i used dirt it's

got white on it so we'll just take it it

will come right down the side here come

right down the outside edge first see

and tap this tap this makes a tree bark

looks sort of fuzzy and that to me is

the way the way old evergreen trees look

they got a sort of textured bark ruff

maybe right in here see how you can

divide that tree up and create a little

hollow in there shoot esco that's where

some little creature lives right in

there

the liquid black and let's take and put

the limb right there right there

sinking put as many limbs as you want in

yours we just put a few in just to show

you how this is just straight liquid

black same there we go

and have some in there that are broken

off evergreens especially why they they

have a lot of oil to get broke off yeah

this is where all the little squirrels

come and set the plane they have to have

a good time too now while we had this

liquid black going here let's just work

on look at there we'll just have it big

sort of hangs right on off the canvas

look at that and there's one right there

and maybe maybe there's one it comes

imagination here

let's sudden these little things just

sort of happen okay we can go right into

you



- welcome back.

certainly glad to see you today.

i thought today we'd do
a painting that's just,

it's a lot of fun, very simple,

and i think you'll enjoy it.

so let's start out and have them

run all the colors across the screen

that you need to paint
this with me at home.

while they're doing that,

let me show you what i
got going up here today.

i have my standard old,

well, i'm using an 18 by 24 inch canvas,

but you use any size that you like

and all i've done is
covered the entire canvas

with a very, very...

let me say it one more time.

a very thin coat of liquid clear.

now, the clear's on here
just to make the canvas

wet and slick

and that's really the
only reason it's there.

be careful when you're using this clear

because you can't see it up here hardly.

it's hard to,

it's hard to tell if you have enough.

if you have any doubt...

because usually, you put too much on.

if you have any doubt,

take a paper towel and wipe it down.

what's left will be just right.

it's better to have too litte

than it is to have too much.

you just wanna make the
paint slide on there.

let's have fun today.

the old two-inch brush.

and i'm gonna use very, very little color.

pull the smallest little amount,

smallest little amount

of the blue out here.

little, tiny bit of blue.

very small amount.

let's go up in here.

now,

very gently

i'm just going to begin

applying some color up here in the sky.

i want the...

let's do a winter scene today.

so,

let's make it very soft,

very misty.

one of those winter...

tell you what,

let's get crazy.

let's get crazy today.

let's have a...

maybe a few little buildings down here

like a little farm scene or something.

i don't know.

just sort of do it and see what happens.

it doesn't matter

because as you know,

in our world, we don't make mistakes.

we just have happy accidents.

it's the only world i live in

where there's no mistakes at all.

that's what makes it so wonderful.

very little color.

shoot, while i got that going,

let's just keep going.

maybe we'll just

put a little bit of this blue all over.

we're gonna have a winter scene

and we're gonna need
some shadows in our snow,

so by applying a little blue down here,

we'll use that later on.

automatically, this
will become our shadows.

and if worst comes to
worst, what the heck?

we'll turn it into a nice lake or pond or

whatever we want.

doesn't matter.

that's what's so nice about this.

you can change your mind right mid-stream.

okay, fun time.

fun time.

let's wash the brush.

as you know,

we wash our brush with
odorless paint thinner.

shake it off.

and just beat the devil out of it.

now, let's go back

with titanium white.

first of all, the prussian
blue is transparent.

it's very transparent.

now, i'm gonna go into an opaque color.

the titanium white

and it is very opaque.

very opaque.

just a little color on here,

and let's go up in here

and let's just play a little bit.

let's just pick out some areas

like this.

we want this painting, as i say, to be

very soft, very gentle

quiet little painting.

i don't want a strong,
distinct sky here that,

that,

will be distracting.

i want a very gentle,

quiet little sky.

and so that's what we shall have.

there.

in our world, we can create
any illusion that we want.

and today,

i want softness in our world.

tranquility, quiet.

peaceful.

shoot, there's too much bad
stuff going on in our world.

we're gonna have a very peaceful place.

everybody's happy,

even the little creatures.

there we are.

that's really, that's
really about all i want

for this sky.

i don't wanna do much more than that.

something about like that.

and i get to wash the brush again.

all right.

i really, really just
wanted to wash the brush.

shake it off.



you know they...

if you're gonna do this at home,

i suggest you get a little
thing called a brush meter rack.

it goes down in a garbage can,

'cause if you do this in your living room,

you're not gonna be very popular.

guarantee.

guarantee.

all right.

let's go into a little black.

very small amount of blue,

but there's very little paint.

very little paint here,

and i just wanna

tap in some little indications,

barely touching the canvas.

little indications far away,

far away,

almost the same color as the sky.

very light, far away.

remember that.

i keep saying it because it's important.

now, you can take this...

i wanna blend the edges
out so it just disappears.

just sort of disappears softly.

softly.

i don't do a lot of soft
paintings on television

'cause they don't show up quite as well,

but i thought today,

we'll do one anyway.

there.

softly.

blending those edges out a little bit

so it just sort of disappears.

if you want to make this

sort of look like it just,

i don't know, like it sort of flows,

almost like a watercolor,

leave a little more paint
thinner on your brush

because paint thinner and liquid clear,

they have a violent reaction

and it'll sort of just
grow and it's beautiful.

looks like watercolor.

there.

something about like that.

that's a little background

or something that's way back here.

we don't even care where it's at.

far away.

let's have one in the foreground,

a little closer to us.

we'll use the same color,

only a little more paint

and i'll add the least,

least little touch of
van dyke brown to it.

but there's still not a great
deal of paint on the brush.

not a great deal. let's go up in here.

tell you what, let me show you something.

i'm gonna take

just the least little
touch of paint thinner.

remember i told you that paint thinner

and liquid clear have a violent reaction.

wipe off all the excess. don't want much.

then we just sort of tap
all these colors together

and

right here,

let's just begin tapping in
some basic little shapes.

very, very basic.

there's paint thinner in here.

not a lot.

i wiped all of it off, as you
saw, that i could get off,

but i didn't beat the brush.

so there's still some in here.

we're just putting indication
of all kinds of little things

that live up in here.

there.

all right.

what's the old saying?

you don't have to be crazy
to do this, but it helps.

sometimes it does.

you really...

this is where you enjoy freedom on canvas.

just let things happen. let them happen.

there.

now, this will continue

to dilute the paint thinner.

will continue to dilute the liquid clear

and you'll get reactions
maybe for several hours.

it'll be very slight,

but it'll be a little bit different.

let me show you. watch here.

you can even take a little

paint thinner on the
fan brush and flick it.

look at that! look at that!

isn't that gorgeous?

look at those effects.

it makes one of the neatest
little nicest things

and all you gotta do...

see? just flick it.

and you can use the knife to flick it

or i'm just using the side
of the palette, whatever.

doesn't matter.

but that'll continue to work.

it looks...

once again, it looks like a watercolor.

all right.

let's put another little
bush. same colors.

just tapping.

each layer gets a little bit darker

as it gets closer to us.

and maybe in our world,

there's one more little tree

lives right here.

we don't know.

don't know that we even care
at this point in our life.

there. just make all
kinds of little things.

okay.

yep, there's another one there.

here's one here.

sometimes you can just
take and push sidewards,

create all kind of little illusions here.

is that another one?

then i'll take it and pull it.

lift it.

see there?

pull those little things out.

that paint thinner

and clear will continue to
work for a while once again.

i like these kind of little paintings.

they're so soft.

so nice.

they're very moody little paintings.

yeah, there we are.

okay.

and that gives us a fairly
good little background.

you can enhance that a little,

taking a little paint thinner,

a little pit of white paint.

put a little blue in it too
just to dull it a little.

and maybe, in our world,

maybe they're some little tree trunks

that live up through here.

just a few.

there we are.

see?

you can pull it down, you can lift it up.

whatever works well for you.

few little things in here.

you can actually just
take plain paint thinner

and do this.

it'll lift the paint off the canvas,

and you can get basically the same effect

by just allowing the
canvas to show through.

there.

all kinds of little doers happening.

now, we decided early

that this was gonna be winter.

let's get the bravery test out here.

we'll go right into titanium white.

titanium white. let's go up in here.

where is the snow?

the easiest way there ever was

to make snow.

there.

just like it.

and it goes (makes painting
noise) right on across.

i don't know.

now see, intentionally,

i went around this tree.

now it looks like this tree is forward.

does that make any sense?

i hope i'm saying that
right so you understand.

sometimes i get so excited, i,

i don't say things right.

but that's just a neat effect, ain't it?

look at that.

it's setting down in the snow.

right out there.

let's see.

we decided we was gonna have
some buildings out here.

maybe one of the easiest ways

that i've found to make a building

is take the knife,

and just firmly

scrape out a basic shape.

it does two things.

most important, it removes excess paint.

secondly, it allows you

to lay out your buildings.

let's put a shed on
this one. what the heck?

maybe that's an old
barn with a shed on it.

like it.

but you can lay out a
whole series of buildings.

maybe there're more than one.

right there.

we don't care.

without being committed, anyway,

that's what i'm trying to say.

you're not committed at this point.

there.

let's take a little van
dyke, little dark cyan,

and mix it together.

van dyke and dark cyan.

i'm just gonna use them together.

and now, we can figure out here

where the dark part is.

and in my world, i think it's right here.

you don't have to stay in the
lines that you scraped out.

you can go anywhere you want with this.

there are no rules here other than

it should make you happy,

and whatever works, is good.

whatever works.

painting is such an individual thing.

every person who's ever painted

has a different opinion of why it works

and how it should work,

but i believe

that it's an individual thing,

and if you're happy with your painting,

then the world's happy with it.

what's the old saying about

if you smile, the world
smiles with you and all that?

same thing here.

we were gonna have a shed here. forgot.

there.

now, we can come back.

still using a knife,

take a little bit of paint,

and maybe,

maybe this building here is straight on.

let me get a little more paint there.

straight on toward us.

and sort of allow that to break sometimes.

makes it looks like the
snow sorta sliding down.



straight down.

woops, got a little
doer hanging off there.

there.

all right.

a little bit more here

for the little shed.

there he is.

looks like icicles right there already.

there.

something about like it.

and that's quick enough

to give us an idea of a little building.

and we take a little
brown and a little white,

mix them together.

little brown, little white.

ooh, that's nice.

don't overmix.

touch.

just pull gently down.

in my mind, i think this little shed

is not gonna get as much light,

so it's gonna be a
little darker back here.

so i'll make it a little darker

so he's pushed back a little more.

i think in my mind this side of the house

will be a little lighter than the front

or the barn, whatever this is.

i don't know what it is.

whatever you want it to be.

a little more brown in there.

this side over here now is
very dark in comparison.

it's sorta, this is sorta
like a three-quarter view.

all right.

clean off the knife.

choose a little edge

and maybe there's a few
little windows in here.

just doop, doop,

three...

there.

see? whole line of little windows.

maybe the cows live in here
and need a place to look out.

they wanna see what's
happening out here too.

there.

we'll put a couple
little windows in there.

it's your world.

you decide what's in there and what's not.

as i've mentioned many times before,

i sort of make up little
stories in my mind.

i'm just pulling a little
brown through there

to make it look like old
boards living in there.

but these little stories,
they really help me.

i don't know if they'll help you,

but i believe they will.

make up little stories about your world.

boy, that's some rough looking snow there.

old snow laying up there.

we need snow on this other building.



there we are.

little bit there.

all right.

now, sometimes when you
have the clear there

this doesn't want to stick too good.

if that's the case, add
a little liquid white

to make your paint a little thinner.

then it'll stick.

it's all you have to do.

over here on this side,

put a little snow out there.

little touch of brown, for
the eve or the overhang.

like it.

shoot.

we're 'bout to have an old building there.

and i want these to look like they've,

they've had a rough life.

real rough life.

we'll take our big brush.

little bit of snow right there.

make a little shadow in the snow.

all we have to do is put a
little blue in there for that.

little darker blue.

all right.

over here .

cut that off like that.

the side like it.

now we're in business.

so we have two little buildings out here.

little bit more of the blue color.

i put some blue down here,

but it's not as dark as i want it to be.

i want it to be a little bit darker.

so i'll just add a little more,

because in our world, we can
add anything that we want.

there.

over in here.

you know,

a couple of shows ago,

i've mentioned something about this easel.

we have a brand new easel in this series.

and we've been absolutely flooded

with requests wanting
to know more about it.

what can i tell you?

it's a very unique easel.

the greatest thing about it

is the top comes off and
makes a tabletop easel.

it has four legs.

most tabletop easels have three.

when you use a brush this big, you hit it,

they fall over.

that's always been a problem,

so we designed an easel

that has four legs

for the tabletop.

then the nice thing about
it, you can order it

with just the top.

you just want a tabletop.

then maybe later on you decide

you wanna get serious about it.

you can go back and order the bottom

and they go right together.

there.

and it...

it's available

i think it most better art stores

across the country.

if you can't find one, drop me a line.

i'll find out where they
are and let you know.

okay.

take a little blue, little white,

mix them together.

maybe in our world...

let's put the indication of...

starts out here at nothing.

we'll just let it come round through here.

just, maybe there's

just an indication of

a little path or road.

little road.

goes right through like that.

just a little dabble.

like it.

comes right off the
edge of the canvas here.

this is just blue and white.

there we are.

and we'll bring a little
snow right up to it.

let it just disappear right off the edge.

and you don't have to
be careful or anything.

you can clean that up...

when you come back with the snow,

you can clean up the edges.

you don't have to worry about it.

just enjoy.

just enjoy.

there.

because maybe,

maybe the wind's blowing the snow

half way over this little road.

you just can't make out

that there's a road there.

the old cows in the barn.

you gotta get up there
and take him some hay.

all right.

don't want the old cow left out.

a little touch of the

alizarin crimson into the...

least little touch into the white.

and maybe

nice distinct something right there

just to break it up.

there we go.

little touch more of that crimson.

that gives it a little warm effect.

there.

see, it creates a whole other plain there,

even in the snow.

you know, look at this.

i think this farm's deserted.

the more i look at it, the more i think

i think this old farm were
abandoned, this place.

yeah, all right.

let's take a little of that brown.

little paint thinner.

liner brush.

very thin paint.

lot of it on the bristles.

liner brush holds a lot of paint.

maybe in our world...

yup, maybe there's an old fence left here.

we can just do this

with a little liner brush.

as they go away from you,

let them get smaller

and closer together.

closer together.

there. see?

and that'll help create
that illusion of distance.

now, maybe there's a little snow on there.

i'll just dip into a little
bit of the liquid white.

just pure liquid white

and we'll put the
indication of a little snow

hanging up here on some of these.

there.



there they are.

gotta make those little noises though,

or it won't work.

take just the knife

and i'll go through a little bit of brown.

use just the heel of the knife.



go right down, we'll put a
little wire on that fence.

just the heel.

so, let it get wider as it comes forward.

there. two strands of wire.

that easy.

that easy.

wish it was that easy to
put that wire on your house.

maybe there's a...

there's another old post up here.

i don't know.

some kind of big old
post that lives there.

little liquid white.

need a little something hanging on him.

sometimes it's nice to add a little blue

to the liquid white.

it'll make your snow look colder.

much, much colder.

let's use a one-inch brush.

i'm gonna go into a little white,

a little bit of the blue.

little white, little bit of blue.

i want this to be sort of a,

a medium blue.

in our world,

maybe there's a few little
bushes that live back here.

i'm just looking for a little dark color

to make some light show up.

maybe there's a happy bush lives there.

looks like a tree.

maybe,

maybe there's another one right in here.

i don't know.

maybe this gentleman takes
care of his yard like i did

and the bushes and the
trees are growing up

and taking over his farm.

now,

another white

or another one-inch brush

going to liquid white.

now, most important how
you load this brush.

come right down here and watch here.

pull that brush in one direction.

isn't that a great close up?

that is fantastic.

pull that brush in one direction.

load a lot of color in it.

watch.

now, i'm gonna turn it over.

see how that's rounded?

you want that rounded
corner to go to the top.

you can also see right there,

we just taped this furrows.

i had people write in and they say

how come your brush looks
different than mine?

we put a little tape on those furrows

just to keep them from shining on tv.

it's identical to your brush.

guarantee.

now, with that nice, white color,

all you gotta to is just go
up here and barely touch.

just barely touch.

we'll put a few highlights on these

snow covered now.

there.

over in here.

just a few little things.

don't want a lot.

just a few.

just a few.

now, my brush has got white on.

it'll work just as well.

come in here.

and with that, you can very gently

clean up the bottom.

sort of begin to bring all this together.

just using white paint.

there. pull that out.

see there.

we didn't add a simple

and super little,

little way to do,

maybe like a little farm
scene in the winter.

now, if you live some place

where there's a lot of farms,

you can look around

and see the type of farms
that are in your area

and paint them to match

what you're used to seeing.

it's up to you.

it's really up to you.

i just wanna show you how to do this.

what you do

is very individual.

all right.

something like so.

okay.

shoot, i think we about got it here.

you might take...

let's say this guy didn't keep his

grass cut very good,

so maybe around here,

we can put a few little sticks and twigs

around some of these posts.

they usually grow there because
you can't cut close to them.

there.

something like it.

let's take a little red,

a little paint thinner,

thin it down 'til it's the consistency,

almost the consistency of ink

and let's sign this little rascal

right there.

just like so.

if your paint's very thin,

it'll flow right over the
top of this thick paint.

that easy.

hope you've enjoyed this one.

it's a very, very simple little painting.

if you've never painted before,

this one you can do.

from all of us there,

i'd like to wish you happy painting

and god bless, my friend.



- welcome back.

today i'd thought we'd do
a little picture that's

little different than
what we've been doing.

and today i wanna emphasize
how to do several ranges

of mountains and have
some in the background

that are very quiet, and very
distant and then come forward

with it and let's see what happens here.

i've already prepared
the canvas with a layer

of magic white, just
brushed in both directions.

okay, we'll start with a
little bit of persian blue

and we're really working to
the bristles of the brush.

and we'll start right at the top

working across

and we're picking up the magic
white as we go across here

and automatically it
makes the sky get lighter

as it works downward.

we don't want a sky that

just looks like you
pulled the curtain down.

we're trying to avoid those.

okay, let me real
hypnotize it a little bit.

okay.

and while we've got some
blue on the brush here,

we might as well go ahead and

put in a little bit of water here.

this is still the persian blue.

and we'll just hypnotize
this a little bit,

bring it all together.

anyway it doesn't matter where
you get your waterline here

because when you put
all the other stuff in,

you can bring it to
whatever points you want it

so don't worry about it.

okay.

we will wash this old brush.

alrighty, let's take some blue

and a little bit of brown

and little bit of white

just to make a gray color, blue gray here.

and maybe we're gonna have
this mountain come way up

on the canvas, what the heck.

and just let it roll around.

we're gonna have a little bump right there

and let it wander right on off.

very little paint and
we're pushing that paint

right into the canvas,
just really push it.

and we'll put a little bump right there,

another little hill.

okay, now we'll take and
pull that paint down.

we want it to get lighter as it goes

toward the horizon here.

so we pull it down.

once again it's mixing
with the magic white

that's already on the canvas
and automatically this occurs.

pull this one down a little.

okay.

like so.

now this time we want very little paint,

very little paint.

all we wanna do is give
little indications back here.

just a little,

few little highlights.

light plane right through here.

and you'll find if you're right handed,

it's normally easier to have the light

coming from the right.

if you're left handed it will
vary from person to person.

so you have to find what's
comfortable for you,

and maybe a little spec of
light back here on that point.

okay, maybe we'll just let
these two work their way

together here.

just make an almighty ridge
coming right through there.

there we go.

now, for the shadow we'll
use a little blue and white,

little touch of brown with it.

let's put a little shadow right here.

don't want a great deal
in the shadows this time,

just a little bit.

maybe a little touch over in here.

few little things happening
all along the way.

little bit too straight so i'm
gonna break that up a little

so it doesn't look too round.

don't want it to look
phony, want it to look real.

okay now i'm gonna
really diffuse this one.

i want it to just about disappear.

even gonna work a little bit in there,

and we'll lift upward.

always follow the angles that
you've built in your mountain.

always work with those angles.

okay now let's build
another one, little closer.

this time i'm gonna put
a little alizarin in blue

to give it a little
bit more of a purplish,

little touch of brown to dull it.

all right.

and let's take this one and
run right up through here.

now this being so dark
should push everything back.

maybe a little bump there.

want this just to be a nice
slow lowling a little hill.

and just get in there and
do it, thing like that.

don't worry about it, let it happen.

there.

and we'll pull this down a little bit.

one reason we do so many
mountains in this series

is to teach you to use the knife

that you can make mountains,

you've made friends with the knife

then you can do just about
anything you wanna do with it.

okay, maybe we'll take a
little blue and white here.

maybe there's a few little
patches of snow laying on this

just here and there.

just let those work down here and there.

there.

and maybe there's a little snow land

right in here somewhere.

just sort of bring that together.

okay and we'll take a little
bit of the blue and brown

and put some sap green with it.

there we go, very dark,
it should look black.

and now we'll load the brush up.

and let's just do some
little things like this.

i want some little indication of trees

way back in the distance back here.

and maybe a few of them have
just a little bit more detail

so we can just add a
little bit here and there.

we're only looking for
basic shapes as far back.

you would not see a great deal of detail.

and here and there nice little trees.

add a little more shape.

okay.

a lot of paint on the
brush, very, very thick.

just like so.

okay, now then we can take

and just scratch a few
little trunks here and there.

and all we're doing here is
using the point of the knife

and cutting through the
paint so the canvas shows.

and it gives the illusion of little trunks

way back in the distance.

and you don't have to worry
about cutting through the canvas

with this knife.

the canvas is very, very strong

and we recommend that
you use stretch canvas

rather than canvas boards.

the canvas boards have
cardboard in the center

and they have a tendency
to absorb your magic white

very rapidly and leave
you with a dry canvas.

and we depend on this being wet

through the whole picture.

okay, now let's take

little gray,

a little yellow and red
all mixed together here

and let's start putting some
land coming down through here.

and all we're gonna do is just push.

like so.

all the little grassy
things happening here.

and maybe here and there we can see little

parts of the dirt showing through,

little areas where there's
some ground showing.

so we just lay that in.

and then you can just
go back and push it down

into the picture, put things
that are projecting over it.

little more magic here,

have to have a thin paint to
make it stick on all these.

and as these come out of the shadow,

let them get a little brighter.

these trees with shadow all back in there.

so you want this to get a
little brighter as it comes out.

there we go.

and let's take and pull just
a little bit of this down

into the water.

there we go.

and then we'll just, just
hypnotize it a little bit,

just make it come together.

here i'm adding just a little bit of dark.

we have two light areas so we'll
put a touch of dark in here

just to separate these,

very, very little paint.

okay, now let's take
a little vandyke brown

and we'll just go right along here and

build me some little shore.

here all we're doing
is touching the canvas.

okay, and we can put a
few little sticks in here

while we have some color on the knife.

you know what, when people
see all these little

sticks and stuff, they think
you've spent days and days

with your one haired brush sitting here

doing all these little rascals,

and when you get them believing that

then you up the price of it.

for a long time i've painted
this way in the secrecy

of my home and charged unbelievable prices

which a lot of painters are doing now.

but if people see it takes you 30 minutes

then they don't wanna pay you
an unbelievable price for it.

they wanna pay you 30 minutes labor, so

you have to make a decision
whether you wanna be a

traditional artist or an
artist that eats regular.

and we'll lay some little
ripples along the water here,

just here and there.

okay, now

maybe we'll take some of this dark color

and let's put a little tree
right here, what the heck.

like so.

and we'll take and pull
some of that paint down,

make this little reflection.

put a little tree trunk in.

and we'll lay a little
highlight right along here

just so it stands out.

and then we need some leaves on it

so i'm gonna drop a few
little leaves here and there.

there we go.

very light touch,

don't want to destroy.

and we'll use just a little
bit of the vandyke here.

okay,

now let's put something in the foreground.

we will have all kind of
nice little bushes and stuff

just growing around here.

and let's put something right here.

there we go.

and we'll highlight these real quick.

look at that, all those
little leaves and bushes

and you can do it.

you can do it,

just practice a little,

load a lot of paint to the brush.

remember thin paints
stick to a thick paint.

maybe just a little greenery on this.

a little something right there.

okay, a few little sticks.

now let's get brave.

let's have a huge limb coming out here

like there's a three over here somewhere

and all you can see is
a big limb coming out.

i know this is scary to

take in and put something like this

right out through all
the work you went through

but give it a try one time.

and maybe we have one
coming down through here.

and then we can have some
little limbs coming off these,

all kinds of little things happening here.

wherever you want them just drop them in.

and there's a little something

just protruding right up here.

okay, now

you could put just a little
bit of highlight on here

just to break it up.

shows a little sunlight is hitting.

yeah.

now let's lay some leaves on top of them

and we first need some dark,

let me get some dark color here.

a little bit of sap, a
little bit of blue and brown.

there we go.

and we'd lay a little
color on the brush here

and now we're just gonna start tapping

where we want some nice
little leaves to be.

just let them fall in there.

there.

just sort of helps make a nice
composition of your picture

and push everything back.

think you'll like this once you try it.

and as i say first time is sort of the

son of a gun distance
through all these right up

in the middle of your picture.

it's gonna scare you a little bit.

but jump in there and do it.

remember you're the master.

this canvas is afraid of you.

you're the master.

okay, now we can take

a lighter color green,

a little more magic in it.

and we'll load this brush full

and think where your light is coming from.

the top of these are
gonna be a little brighter

than the bottom so we'll just
lay a little bit of color

right along the top here.

this is where you need
a good brush though.

be very careful about the brush you use.

avoid nylon brushes, they cut paint.

these are natural bristle brushes.

put the color right in here.

i always remember back when
i was a traditional painter

how long i would agonize trying
to do something like this

with the little one haired brush

and working for days and days and days

to get an effect that you
can now get in minutes.

okay.

there we go,

and we have almighty limbs projecting

right out in our picture

and makes it look like
there's a tree over here.

okay, maybe,

maybe right in here.

let's do this.

let's have an old tree that's falling over

coming right up through here.

if you got all your nerve
up and done this one,

shoot, we might as well
just keep going with it.

no use letting you stop now.

and maybe he had a little
friend that fell over with him.

there we go.

now don't laugh, trees need friends too.

everybody needs friends.

okay.

take a little white and little brown here.

now you'll put just a
least little touch of

sort of an orangey color in it.

and we're gonna just
work that right down here

and make him look old and tired,

just barely touching.

just pull that right along

like so.

let it go.

okay, now we'll take

and put a few little bushes in front

so he has a place for his foot to sit.

and we'll take the liner brush,

a little bit of thin oil like so.

there we go.

and we'll put a few little
limbs hanging on here

that are just about going,

just here and there.

let them go wherever which
way, whatever makes them happy.

and maybe this one is just hanging down.

he's tired,

poor old thing.

there.

this old tree is just about going,

it's gonna fall over here in the pond.

maybe a little limb or two left up here,

something like so.

okay, i think we'll sign that one

and call it finished

and there we go.

and i'd like to thank you very, very much

for watching us today.

i hope you've enjoyed this painting

and that you've painted along with us

and until next time, happy painting.

thank you very, very much.





- hello, welcome back.

i thought today, we'd
do an almighty picture

that had some huge mountains in it

and maybe today, we'll
also work a little bit on

putting some clouds floating
in front of the mountains.

this is always something
that's very difficult to do,

so i'll try to show ya how to do that

and i hope you have a canvas
set up on your almighty easel

and cool drink in hand and let's go here.

i'm gonna start with a little
bit of alizarin crimson

and a touch of prussian blue

and maybe we'll just make
a sky that's sort of a

lavender type and sorta taste it, test it.

there we go.

i already have magic white on the canvas.

so, we're just literally mixing paint

right here on the canvas.



and we'll just bring this
down to about like so.

there we go.

now, go into just a little prussian blue

and we'll lay this right
in like so, there we go.

okay.

and while we have the
old brush dirty here,

i'll take a little phthalo
green in prussian blue

and we'll lay in some water here.

and already, we have a masterpiece for

a museum of modern art somewhere.

okay, now we'll clean the old brush.

be sure it's good and dry.

then, this is just a clean, dry brush

and we're just gonna bring
these two colors together here.

okay.

just do you have a nice blending.

you don't wanna be able
to tell where one stops

and the other one starts.

and we'll hypnotize it
and sort of blend it out.

okay, now let's take the fan brush,

a little bit of titanium white

mixed with a touch of permanent red

just to give it a little pinkish hue.

we don't wanna set these clouds on fire.

all we wanna do is give
it just a little hue here,

just a little pinkish hue

and we'll push us in some
nice little clouds here.

we're pushing very hard
just to push the value

right into the canvas.

and maybe we'll put little
cloud floating around

right here.

okay.

we'll take and gently, gently, gently

blend that together.

very light, delicate touch.

don't overwork these clouds.

they're very, very easy to overwork 'em.

then we'll hypnotize 'em.

okay, let's build us an almighty mountain.

we'll take a little bit of blue

and some brown, touch of alizarin.

and a little bit of white.

there we go.

and mix your color marbley.

don't mix it dead.

let's start way up here.

put us an almighty mountain.

maybe there's a nice
little peak over here.

let this drop down.

we're really pushing this
paint into the canvas.

maybe we'll have another
little peak over in here.

and we'll take off all the excess paint.

then we'll take the big
brush and pull it down

just to make sure we've
got all the paint off of it

that can come off.

all we wanna leave is
the value in the canvas,

the color.

now, we'll start with a
little bit of titanium white

and i'm gonna mix a little
bit of brown and blue with it

just to gray it down.

just a little bit.

we can start putting
some highlights on this

almighty mountain.

maybe we'll have a little peak rolling

right down through there.

maybe a little light's
hitting right up here.

and for shadow color,
we'll take a little bit of

blue and brown and white

mixed with a little darker value.

and we'll just lay us some
shadows right in here.

and each little highlight
needs it's own private shadow.

maybe we'll add another little peak here.

this is your mountain, so you can add

what you want to on it.

now let's diffuse the bottom of it

and here, we're just gently tapping.

don't wanna destroy, just diffuse.

and then we'll pull just to take out

the little tap marks.

now, we'll lay some clouds
on top of the mountain.

and i've added a little bit of magic white

with my paint just to make
it a little bit thinner.

you remember our golden rule here.

thin paint'll stick to a thick paint.

so, maybe we'll have a little cloud here

that just floats right
across the mountain.

okay.

maybe right up here, there's one too.

seems like i remember one up here.

now, very carefully, we'll blend this in.

super light touch here.

okay, let's take

and let's work on this peak now.

let's let him travel down and

just come right down
in the foreground here.

give him a few little shadows

so he stands out as an individual.

and maybe a few little shadows in here.

okay and once again, we'll diffuse this

just to lay some mist in here.

and then, maybe another
little layer of clouds

and we'll add a little more magic white

to keep the paint thin.

and maybe this one just drops
right out of the sky here.

and plays around the bottom.

there we go.

just nice, soft little clouds.

okay, this is a very, very delicate touch.

there.

and maybe we'll just take and

maybe there's another
little stone right in here.

travels around.

just to show ya how to continually
bring things forward here

and we need this to be a little darker

than the background back here.

and we'll lay some
highlights right on here.

let that paint break.

let it break so you have all
these little holes in it.

let some of the dark show through.

there we go.

and maybe just a few little clouds,

little misty areas
floating around in here.

this creates a tremendous
illusion of distance,

makes things far, far away.

now, we'll just hypnotize
this a little touch.

and it's vitally important,
when you're doing this at home,

that you use a paint
that's very, very firm.

otherwise, you have nothing that's thinner

to go over the top of it, so be sure

to use a very firm paint.

okay, let's mix us up a little color.

we'll add a little

sap green, little more blue in here.

maybe just a touch more alizarin.

there we go, nice color.

and don't mix it dead,
remember not to mix it dead.

and we'll take this old big brush

and let's put us some little
foothills right in here.

don't let the size of this
big brush scare you away.

use it, it does fantastic things.

now i'm gonna give it
just a little upward sweep

to make it look like little trees

way, way back in the distance.

there we go.

then we'll tap a little bit here

just to lay some mist in between these.

we'll have two of 'em, i think.

now we'll add a little more of the brown

and a little more of the blue just to

darken it up a little bit here.

all the same colors.

blue, brown, a little alizarin, sap,

just to make it a little bit darker

so it'll look like it's in front.

there we go.

we'll lay another little ridge of

foothills right down through there.

we'll give those a little upward swirl.

just barely, barely
touching the canvas here.

okay.

now we can start coming forward.

and we'll take a little bit of sap green

mixed with a little bit of alizarin

and then i'll mix that into some yellow.

makes sort of a dirty green color

and we'll start putting some little trees

that are way back here.

load a lot of paint in your brush

and just push upward.

there, all these little things happening

way back in the distance.

and maybe just a little
touch of yellow right here.

just let this blend right
with the color that you had.

let it go.

now i'm gonna take and
pull just the edges down.

don't overwork this
because you're working with

yellow into the blue water and it'll just

turn it bright green on ya.

just pull it down,
hypnotize it a little bit,

and leave it alone.

now we can put a few little
sticks here and there.

just cutting through the
paint is all we're doing.

make it look like little trunks
way back in the distance.

we'll take just a little
touch of phthalo green

mixed with a cad yellow

and a little bit of permanent red.

and we'll put some
highlights on these trees.

just where the sun's running through there

and sparkling on top of 'em.

there we go.

now, some straight vandyke brown

and we just lay us a
little, little bit of dirt

and gravel and stuff in here.

this isn't straight magic
white and we're just gonna

lay it right underneath here

just to give us a little water line.

and when you're doing this at home,

you'll have a lot more
time than we do here.

you can take your time
and put in all the little

fantastic details that
you want to back here.

okay.

let's begin moving this
in a little bit closer.

using the same colors.

we'll just start coming forward.

maybe we need a nice tall
little tree right here.

let's put us a little bush over here also.

can't leave this side out.

there we go.

just lay that in.

ya know, we'd love to hear from ya

and love to hear how
you're doing with all this

and if it's helping you.

we'd like to know what you
wanna see on these shows.

if you wanna see different things painted,

different techniques.

we'd also maybe like to, in the future,

bring some of the better instructors

that we have met across the united states

and maybe we'll have them demonstrate some

unbelievable techniques that can be done.

but we need to know what
you want, so let us know.

now, let's take a little bit of the brown

and we'll just lay some
little trunks here and there.

maybe we'll give this
little bush one here.

and we'll put some highlights on that.

still fascinates me how this works

and how beautifully it works.

okay, let's see, maybe we need a little,

there, that's it.

and down in here, we
need some little bushes

that are hiding underneath
this bigger one.

and we'll put some little
reflections in the water.

there we go.

little red fireball there.

okay.

little touch more of the magic white

just to thin it down a touch.

let's go over here

and we'll put some nice little
highlights on this tree.

there we go.

leave a lot of these dark areas in here.

they create the shadows that
you need so desperately.

and we'll put a little color right here

for reflections.

then we can lay a little
color right on top

to give us nice, beautiful reflections.

right there.

okay.

now, let's take a little
more of the straight brown

and a little bit right along here

and we'll just draw in
some little bit of shore,

little bank here.

lay a little highlight on top of that.

touch here.

okay, let's see what we got going here.

looks like we have a
lot of space up in here

that we really need to do something with.

so, let's do this.

this is alizarin, crimson,
little bit of sap green.

now we've gotta do something up here

'cause we've thrown
all this color in here.

there we go.

maybe we'll put a little
bit right out here too.

looks so good, we might as well not stop.

we'll take a little bit of vandyke brown

and let's do us an almighty tree coming

right up through here.

there he is.

and you're just sort of
pulling this sideways

to lay the paint right on the canvas,

let it pull off the knife.

and maybe we can give him
some little arms out here.

there we go.

and there's another one.

and maybe this is a
separate little entity,

little tree by itself growing down here.

just a little sprout off the big one.

now we can put some
highlights on these leaves.

and just let it touch.

bend the bristles just
the least little bit.

there we go.

few over here.

isn't that fantastic that you can create

an almighty tree that fast?

we'll put a little highlight
here in this one too.

don't want him to feel left out.

let's put a little something over here

to give this a feel of bark.

just here and there.

there we go.

let's see.

maybe over here.

let's be brave.

let's put an old, dead
tree right up through here.

and this old tree is tired.

he's just about to fall down.

not too much left for him.

we'll give him a little tired arm.

there we go.

and here and there.

just let these happen.

good.

maybe another little stick right there.

alrighty.

now, maybe we'll do
something a little touch

different here.

i'm gonna take a little
bit of the permanent red

and sorta highlight this old tree,

just run it down through there.

there we go.

and if we wanted to make
a few more little branches

on this tree, we can take

a little bit of the thin oil

and thin this down and we can lay

just a few more little
branches here and there.

just a few that's hangin' on.

most of 'em have already fallen off.

okay, now we'll put something here

to cover up his foot, so it pushes him

back down in there.

let's do the same thing over here.

need to push him back into the picture.

and maybe we can take a little more of the

sap green and alizarin combination

and let's do this.

maybe we'll just project this right on out

toward us here.

give him some highlights.

okay, there we go.

by now, if you're
painting at home with us,

you should begin having
a picture that's getting

close to being completed.

should have listed your
spirits up very high

and ready to go to another one.

we just put a little
magic white under here

to give us a little water line

like so.

and let's put a few little
sticks here and there.

okay, there.

now, this is a most interesting picture

because of the mountains

and once again, the biggest thing

we'd like for you to learn from this one

is the laying of clouds
in front of mountains

and how to make these mountains be pushed

far, far away.

okay, these little sticks
show all different planes.

they create the illusion of distance.

okay, i think this one's just about ready

for a signature.

so, we'll take a little of the thin oil,

mix it up real good, make
it almost like water here.

and we'll just lay a little
signature right there.

and i'm very fortunate 'cause
i have a short name so,

only takes me a second to do so.

and i think we'll call that one finished.

if we mess with it any
more, we're gonna start

fiddling it to death.

do your picture, get
your dream out on canvas

and leave it alone.

don't fiddle with it all day.

in the time you spend fiddling,

you could do another picture.

so, thank you very, very
much for watching us.

we hope to see you again and until then,

happy painting.



hey welcome back i'm glad you could join

me today today i have a very special

treat for you i'm very proud to present

my son steve steve's a fantastic artist

that we send all over the country to

teach the joy of painting and i've asked

him to come in today and to show you

what he can do in just a couple of

minutes so we're going to turn the show

over to steve i'll be back at the end of

the show and see what you've done thanks

dan well i've already covered the canvas

with a thin even coating of liquid white

and the way i'm going to start out today

is just touching the brush into a little

bit of a lizard and crimson and bringing

it out into a separate space on the

palate just tapping it straight down

turn your brush over tap tap

now when the alizarin crimson hits the

liquid white it will turn a pink color

it won't look like it does on the palate

so i'm just going to start right in

using horizontal strokes but holding the

brush sideways instead of the

traditional flat way like this this

gives you a little bit more movement in

your sky

and with that same dirty brush can get a

little bit more alizarin crimson

and maybe a touch of phthalo blue and

i'll come right up here to the left-hand

corner and you just kind of bring that

right down under the alizarin and always

keep your corners the darkest because

your sons coming from the center of this

painting maybe a tiny bit of light blue

in the center and a little bit more blue

and alizarin and we'll go up into this

corner and make a real dark to

and we'll pick up a little bit more that

and throw some water in real quick while

we got it on the brush it's important

that you use mostly the same colors

throughout the whole painting it

captures the eye better if you do if you

use 70 different colors in one painting

it usually doesn't look too good and i

might even throw a little reflection in

the center there now that we got all our

shapes in here i'll go back with a clean

brush and just blend that out blending

the alizarin first because once you hit

blue with your brush it'll destroy any

alizarin it hits always using that x

that's what gives you that movement if i

was just to brush it straight back and

forth across that just be one solid

color

and since your corners are real dark

make sure you blend them real firmly the

more pressure you add on the brush the

more the paint will move for you and do

a little hypnotizing and come down here

in the water just pulling this all

straight in okay now i'm going to use my

fan brush and just going through a

little bit of titanium white and you can

add a touch of a lizard into that maybe

make your clouds kind of pink

now this painting is going to have big

clouds and it won't start one right here

sometimes you don't want such a bold

looking cloud and if you didn't you'd

use a probably number three fan brush

rather than a number six like i'm using

it's really your choice little clouds

big clouds whichever you prefer and

that's what you do if you get it here in

your cloud

clouds are usually real flat on the

bottom and nice and puffy on top if you

remember that you really can't go wrong

on clouds now with my big brush

preferably a clean one i'll blend the

bottom of the cloud out i never touched

the top of the cloud that's where you

want the most of your highlight to stay

and just pull up on it a tiny bit this

is real light three hairs and some air

as my dad would say and hypnotized it

okay and that about does it for the sky

now i'm going to take my pallet knife i

go through a little bit of brown and a

little bit of a lizard and a little bit

of blue kind of stripe them out like

that into three different piles then

take a little bit from each one and put

them together in the center and mix that

together real good kind of gives you a

dark purple color and will come right up

here and make a big bold mountain now

it's important that you don't kind of

linger around here and and mess around

with the shape too much because it

really doesn't matter as long as you

have three or four peaks the highlight

is what really counts it's what really

makes your mountain

probably the thing i would want to tell

you to stay away from right here is

getting too much paint on the mountain

you want to scrape it all the way down

to bare canvas and then go back in with

your big brush and pull it out and that

way you get some of this paint glow down

here to mix in with the mountain

sometimes whether you do it on purpose

or not it's good to leave a real dark

line in back of the mountain because

that kind of makes it look like a super

super dark shadow when you're doing

putting the highlights and shadows on

sometimes that just turns out as a happy

accident it usually just ends if they're

on purpose in other words and all i'm

doing is just getting a roll of paint on

the knife like this just pull it out

flat go straight through and you get

your roll and touching and just barely

just as light as a feather pulling

and i've got a tiny bit of a loser in

there just like in the clouds

and maybe this mountain will have a big

valley and it you ever see that show the

big valley that's where this mountain

comes from now i'm going to mix up a

little bit of shadow color and to do

that you just use the base color that

you use for the mountain a little bit of

white and some prussian blue now you get

a roll on your knife just like you did

with the white except this time you push

up into the white a little bit and pull

away from it and that drags some of that

light out onto the shadow side of the

mountain too so it doesn't just look

like it's split directly down the center

push up and pull

it gets kind of tight right in these

curves and the valleys right there and

you have to come back and clean that up

a little bit sometimes see like right

around this edge i don't want to come

back

and maybe over here we'll have a tiny

little glacier and that need how you can

just decide what you want in a painting

and just put it right in there

makes it so easy just like my dad i use

little brushes for a long time before i

ever started using big ones and it's

just there's no comparison at all too

much too much pedaling around with

little stuff okay throw a shadow behind

that and we're just about ready to make

our mist

and to do that we take our big brush tap

tap tap tap with the angle of the

mountain and pull up with the angle and

if you have a shadow crossing over your

light like right here then you can come

back and put one or two little strokes

there because obviously you can't have a

shadow casting a highlight okay now with

my one-inch brush i'll take a little bit

of our base color brown alizarin blue

and mix those all together and maybe

i'll even throw a tad a sap green in

there and to that you mix white

probably the ugliest color you could get

at this point would be the best one to

use because ugly colors look more

natural in a painting than real bright

flashy colors you know see what i mean

here in a minute

now without destroying the mist you have

on the mountain you just want to tap in

a shape kind of a rolling yellow shape

don't make it any harder than it is

though just as easy as it looks

just splattering it right in and with a

clean brush i'll come back and lift that

up just maybe a quarter of an inch right

on the top and this gives you the

illusion of little trees in the

background

now if you don't pull it straight up

it'll look like grass and we're

definitely too far away to be seeing

grass now when you get down in here just

pull all this up and then take the edge

of your brush and smash in and this will

create mist down at the bottom you can

pull that up now with that same dirty

brush i used for the first foothill i'll

add a little bit more brown and blue

always makes your paint on your brush so

you can get a marbled effect in your

color if you mix it up with a knife and

you just have one flat color and you

don't usually see that in nature

and try to keep your shapes a little bit

different on this one and like before

pull this up if you want to get really

realistic about it then you should pull

these trees up a tiny bit higher than

the last row because they are getting a

tiny bit closer to you

i've been traveling around teaching

classes since i was about 15 years old i

started out with my dad and by the time

i was 17 i was teaching my own classes

and i'll tell you one of the biggest

things about teaching painting is not

really the teaching of it but what you

get out of the teaching of it and what

you get out of the teaching of it is

practice of course when you go into a

classroom and teach people how to paint

you might do 30 paintings worth of

bushes or something trying to show them

exactly how to do it

so sometimes teaching can be a way to

learn now over here on the left side i

think i'll throw in a bushy tree

and what trees are is just a lot of

bushes in one so you make each

individual bush and kind of bring them

all together see how this is a bush here

and this is one here and this is one

here i'll just kind of bring a row of

grass that's a little bit darker right

in front of the foothill and you want to

kind of make it come around like this so

that when i pull the reflections out

it'll look like this is around the bend

or something it leads the eye into the

painting rather than out of the painting

if i had the land going up like this

then you'd want to just have your eye go

right out now i'm going to put in a

little trunk this is just using van dyck

brown just touching and the way i'm

doing that is just getting a tiny rule

paint and touching the canvas real

lightly down here at the bottom of

course the trunk is going to be a little

bit fatter to hold up that top part and

maybe a little bit of highlight on that

i'll just use a little bit of brown and

white together

just kind of pulling across the brown

letting the thick areas pick up the

light this will be an old birch tree and

with the same and dirty brush you used

to make the tree you can go into a

little bit of paint thinner and threw

some cadmium yellow just kind of pulling

through the paint until you start to see

little bushes in the paint like right

there and that's when you know you're

ready to turn the brush over where that

heals to the top and come in and just

barely touch sometimes it looks like

we're taking a run and jumping leaf and

smashing it in but we're really not

we're just doing it real lightly

and remember where your light source is

coming from it's coming from over here

so you don't want this side of the tree

over here to be darker and don't bring

leaves all the way down to the bottom of

the tree there now with that same color

well i've already got it on my brush

i'll go out here and make a few little

bushes one here and one there you don't

want to make them all the same color

so i'll take a little bit more paint

thinner still using that same dirty

brush you can almost get away with not

ever cleaning the brushes if you do it

just right this is yellow ochre i'm

using now not the prettiest color but

like i said at the beginning of the

painting all colors aren't supposed to

be pretty and maybe some indian yellow

there's a little trick that i teach my

students when i'm not traveling around

if you're going to put any sort of red

in your painting then you want to put it

in the center because the eyes always

must attract it to the brightest color

and if you put red in a painting then

obviously it's going to be the brightest

color i like to mix red and indian

yellow it gives you a real fire color

and you don't need but maybe one of

these are one little teeny idea of red

you can see how much difference that

makes now underneath all of this stuff

hanging over the water will drop a

little land and you do that just by

getting a roll like you did for the

mountain and touching and then pulling

and sometimes you can even pull and then

drop over like this that gives a real

good effect

still keeping that round bend look and

to highlight that we use that same old

brown of white color maybe with a tiny

bit of blue in it and i'm just letting

the white pick up on the brown where

it's real thick and real dense and it's

important that you let some brown come

up into your bushes and stuff too so i

can come back with a fan brush and a

little bit of yellow on it maybe a drop

of paint thinner to thin that down and

make some grasses

okay now i take my big brush and pull

just a tiny bit of this out just barely

grabbing the edge of the land and see is

the land gets bigger so does a

reflection naturally so when you get all

the way over here pull it all the way

down to the bottom and then you can use

a clean brush or semi clean in this case

to go back and forth make it look more

like water and now i'm ready to make my

dreaded water line this is where i run

into more problems when i'm teaching

everybody has problems with their water

line you pull it out flat like i did

there and you cut across it and what

you're doing is just getting a real fine

line white on the edge of your knife and

then you're cutting it straight in

almost like you're trying to cut a hole

through the canvas and keep it straight

all the way around the bend i know that

sounds hard and you'll have a tendency

to want to put in a sideways line but

don't ever do it always keep it straight

okay and maybe right over here we'll

have one big huge pine tree and pine

trees are real easy you just kind of

make them in a in a zigzag shape see

just kind of zigzag it right down a lady

in one of my dance classes used to call

these z trees because you make it

basically like a z and here maybe a bush

or two now with that same dirty fan

brush you can go in and put a little bit

of highlight on your tree and see how

that dirty color you had on there mixes

with the yellow and makes kind of a

green that's what you're looking for and

not every branch but maybe every third

branch or every second branch you want a

little bit of highlight and a small

trunk maybe let's see

and to finish it up some real bright

bushes up front well as thieves finish

to this painting up i would like to come

in here and thanks to you very much for

demonstrating the joy of painting today

and we look forward to seeing you again

so from steve and i happy painting and

god bless bye bye

you

you

you

hi i'm glad you could join me today you

ready to do a fantastic little painting

what come on let's do it let's start out

and have them graphically run all the

colors across the screen that you need

to do this painting with me and they'll

come across in the same order that i

have them on the palette starting with

the titanium white and working around i

thought today would do a beautiful

little winter scene i'm you know partial

to winter scene since i lived in alaska

for so many years so let's go up here

and do it i've already covered the

canvas with a nice thin even coat of the

liquid white it's wet and select ready

to go dan we'll start out with a little

touch of the bright red and let me say

that again a little touch it is very

strong just tap a little bit into the

two-inch brush there it's just a small

amount i guess go right up here and

maybe we'll come let's go right in here

just put in a happy little global don't

want to set this on fire all we want to

do is create a little glow right across

here be careful

once again this bright red can eat up

your whole world in just a heartbeat

there now that's mixing with a liquid

white and you get a beautiful warm glow

and maybe we'll just put a little bit

right down in here what the heck

anything we don't like we just cover up

and if we like it it's already there

without cleaning the brush same old

dirty brush i'm gonna go right into the

least little touch of indian yellow it's

a very transparent now i'm allowing that

red that was already in the brush to mix

with the yellow there we go okay just go

back up here now right above the red

small amount of the indian yellow and

use a little crisscross strokes little

x's and just blend all that together

it's like so very soft and very quiet we

can just take the clean off the brush

down here we don't care now then i have

some midnight black going right here i'm

going to take a little black and a

little bit of the phthalo blue and we

just mix it together right on the brush

just tap it i still have not cleaned the

brush i'm lazy if i can keep them clean

the brush boy i'm all for that can't

just go right up in here still use the

little crisscross strokes and drop in a

happy little sky yeah back and forth

gonna come right down into there like so

get a little touch more of the color i

just black the black in there just to

just a gray it a little bit alright okay

let me clean the old brush now as you

know that's my favorite part of the

paintings is cleaning this whole brush

shake off the excess just give it a nice

little wrap there okay now with just a

clean dry brush and be sure it's dry you

sure it's dry that may be one of the

biggest single problem areas we we hear

people talk about is that the brush is

not dry and they wash their painting

drip right off on the floor let me get

upset with me and i really i really want

this to work for you and i want you to

be happy with it there we go

okay very soft and gentle just so you

can blend this to any degree of softness

that you want just sort of look at it

make a decision and go for it this is

your painting your world so you can you

can create any kind of illusion that you

want on this piece of canvas let's have

some fun

take the old round brush i'm gonna go

into a little bit of the van dyck brown

little dark sienna and just tap it tap

it very firmly let's go right up here

maybe right in here we back in the

distance lives a few happy little trees

just like so this would have been a good

scatter well we might do it yet we might

put a happy little cloud in there go

ahead and put these in yes like so there

we go these will be far far away okay

tell you what let's do put a little

cloud in there just want to show you how

to do that

we'll use a fan brush today go right

into the titanium white pull it through

a little lot of paint into the bristles

a lot of paint okay let's go up here

maybe right in here lives a happy little

cloud i use just the corner of the brush

turn it wiggle it normally you should do

this before you start putting your

background trees in i just changed my

mind decided i want to put a little

cloud in here but when you're doing this

at home i would i would really advise

you do it before you put your background

trees it'll save you a lot of trouble

there they have it let's take a nice

clean dry brush and i'm using just the

top corner of the two-inch brush to

blame the bottom of the clouds out

barely touching tiny little circles tiny

little circles see there

now after that bird this is a big circle

big grab it lift it upward you're still

just barely touching the canvas and then

very lightly blend the entire sky see

thanks and that here you can drop in a

happy little cloud clouds used to drive

me crazy when i was traditional painter

i'd worked for days trying to put in a

little clown i'm going back to my round

brush the dark sienna the van dyck brown

so you just really tap it in there get

tough with it

tap hard just go back up there i tell

you i'm having so much fun these little

trees yeah there's one he lives right

there we don't wanna get loneliness

giving a friend his friend lives there

whatever we're going down here we really

don't have to worry about down here yet

a little bit later we'll begin to worry

about such things but right now all

we're doing is applying some very very

basic little shapes i just want that

pinkish glow to be really shining

through the trees look at that nice tree

that lives there think about the shape

of a tree just think about it make up

little stories about trees it's a little

taller you can get carried away with

these i'd like to do trees you know

buddy travel all over the country doing

demonstrations for for pbs stations and

other fantastic groups all over the

country and it's unreal some of the

fantastic new modern equipment they've

come out with recently i was doing a

demonstration in a small town and there

was probably about 150 200 people had

showed up and they they gave me up and

tastic me microphone and it was wireless

and i didn't have any wires or anything

on and i forgot it was on so just before

the show i went to the bathroom

needless to say with a wireless mic when

i came back everybody knew her i'd

dinner

i don't even worse what i've been doing

to be careful some time all right

a basic tree lying in here if you want

to call it that we're doing is just

tapping now then let's take the script

liner brush and i'll dip it in a small

amount of paint thinner and i want this

paint to be just like water a liquid

turn that brush that pulls it to it a

nice sharp point see how sharp it is and

it has long bristles on it get scoop

here

now here and there i did a happy little

tree trunk just drop me wherever you

want maybe there's wine that lives right

there and let these old trunks just sort

of wiggle and jiggle and carry on we

don't want them all to be future

telephone poles keep it moving if you

have trouble making your paint stick add

a little more of the paint thinner

okay maybe up in this whole tree there's

a big one lives there turn that brushes

you're pulling us down turn it allow it

to pick up all the color that's

underneath there we go and we're gonna

cover up most deadly you're not really

looking for a lot of detail right here

just some basic shapes let's go over in

this one told him to be left out give

him a little trunk but maybe here's one

sticking out through there

i can't why night there maybe it goes

right i lost the canvas we don't know

where it goes all right yeah i won't

take it

another round brush and i want to begin

highlighting some of these things and

really making them stand out so start

off with a touch this is titanium white

and then i'm gonna pick up a little bit

of the phthalo blue and maybe i should

say that a little stronger a little bit

it's like the red it is very very strong

very powerful it'll eat up all the white

in the world in just a matter of a

second but to tap that brush you really

want to get a lot of paint in there a

lot of paint

okay let's go to the canvas now i want

this painting to have both some cool

colors in it and some nice warm colors

so let's cool right up here and i'm just

gonna use a top corner of the brush

to begin tapping on all kinds of little

things like it maybe i'll add a little

more white to my color so you can see it

a little better there you go there see

just all kinds of little little frosty

thanks hmm and if you have trouble

making your paint stick

i had a small amount of the liquid white

so you just sort of dip it right out

into a little liquid white and then go

back through it and because this is a

little thinner then it will stick very

easily takes a very little pressure on

the brush here maybe lives a happy

little push this is what keeps a little

rabbit warm in the winter

he's got to have a place to cut 11b be

cozy

don't worry not hearing this cold we're

gonna have snow down here then i'm going

back to my other round brush and with it

go into a little bit of yellow to the

bright red a yellow ocher cad yellow and

then to the red okay let's go back up

here now right here with this nice glow

is i want to use some nice warm colors

just let them sort of bounce through

jess let them bounce through add a

little more becca there see you said all

those little things happen and work in

the layers maybe on this tree here the

lights playing through there

lucky there all those little colors

beautiful little things happen this is

all the yellows with a little bright red

now who sets our lights coming through

there over here to will sparkle these up

with a little color still working in

layers indian yellow a little bit of the

red just go right up here put a little

bit out in here they're so round brush

makes a fantastic little leaf effects

for distant trees i really like it for

distant trees don't want to get too much

don't like it now i'm going back to my

round brush that has the blue and the

white on it and let's begin playing some

of those colors right into it so it just

looks like a light striking over there

on the side every once a while i'm gonna

add a little bit more of the liquid

white so it sticks easy okay yeah we

just sort of let these come together all

the little warm colors and the cool

colors are all playing together there

okay let's go back over here maybe

there's a happy little tree yeah we

could just quickly drop on a few little

things here and there

think about some basic patterns just

don't throw things on at random there's

one right there wherever you are and you

can put as many or as few in your world

as you want if you want to look like

they're hanging down use more of the

brush and just tap downward it's also a

super way if you're painting weeping

willows they're beautiful trees and

they're probably one of the easiest

trees are to paint

oh kinds of little hang you down okay

yeah well i got this old dirty brush

going here i'm just gonna pull a little

bit of this color just like so i begin

thinking about the lay of the land out

here and all we do here is just putting

in some base color we're not really

concerned about what it is at this point

it's picking up some of those browns and

all the colors that we have in the trees

pulling all that out too but it gives

you a feeling of the lay of the land and

it gives you a starting point something

to work with okay let me find my fan

brush here i'm gonna get him and let's

begin putting in some details we'll go

right into a titanium white i touch just

a touch of the bright red okay now then

you have to make some big decisions

where is the snow let it begin playing

pulling it across see use very little

pressure and that color it's underneath

shows through and it automatically will

make beautiful shadows for you there's

always little bumps and stuff just

create all kinds of happy little things

there comes one i see one right there

then blend it out a little

yeah just like so come right now across

and you just keep going on them however

many you want there's another one just

layer after layer after layer let's have

some fun make some big decisions and

what else do we want in here maybe maybe

little cabin you know me i'm i'm crazy

about little cabins hmm

so let's try them back to you what will

we will paint the cabin let's use it

let's use a big brush today we'll take

the 2 inch brush pull it through the

paint now i'm using the dark sienna and

the van dyck brown and just mix them on

the brush see when you pull it wiggle it

wiggle it both sides and then sharpen it

just like you would or a knife i just

pull it right through there and look at

the sharp edge look at that it comes to

a very sharp chisel edge okay let's go

right up here now you got to make a big

decision

where's your little cabin liver maybe

today we'll have a big old cabin yeah

i'm gonna do the back eve first so we

just paid it off like so hello to little

more paint and then we pull it straight

down all we're doing here is applying a

base color okay we need a other side of

the house

see they just pull it down and a lot of

paint a lot of paint on them i want that

to be very strong then another side

right here straight down like that now

since our light source is coming from

here we want this side of the cabinet to

be lighter then over here so over here

be sure this side is a good and dark

real dark so it stands out nice okay now

same old dirty brush i'm gonna go right

into a little bit of the white a little

blue and just tap a little bit on the

brush see just a little on the brush

here do both sides and you can see it a

little better maybe see there can't go

back up here add it i want this to look

like old weathered wood so all i'm gonna

do is just start touching and letting it

bounce and come right down can you see

that it looks like it's old old old

looks like my house okay now i'm gonna

do the same thing i'm gonna make it

darker once again i had a little black

to it once again we want the side over

here to be darker so load a lot of paint

let's go back up there now then over

here we want the same basic thing see

just barely touching and let it work

down so it looks a hold you're sort of

touching and pushing at the same time a

little bit on this side i can't come

right

a little house is about to fall over now

then we can take the knife and work on

our perspective here a little bit we'll

see yeah you can just cut it off

whatever you want it just like so and we

need a roof on that cabin so it takes

them the titanium white we use at night

let's go right up here and lay in a

little snow-covered that simple just let

it work right down and you could take

clean this edge up make it nice and

smooth bet it overhang a little bit then

grab it and pull there you go how easy

it is to make a happy little cabin put a

little snow on this side i can have at

least least little touch of the phthalo

blue i want to make it look like here's

that edge on here

they'll blue over here just a little

blue with white tiniest tiniest little

mountain already i tell you what let's

do take the van dyck brown pile without

very flat cut across and get just the

smallest little roll of paint right on

the edge of the knife i have it right

along here well just touch and make the

indication of all kind of little boards

whole weathered boards there we go

dude do the tooth dope - and you can put

as many boards and your cabin as you

want put something out here

then we could take our liner brush we're

just a little the liquid white on it

we'll put the indication of some happy

little icicles hanging off here there we

go there we go whew over on this side

every mini whatever that gives us a

little icicle this old guy he's probably

he's probably we ran out of storage

space

i'm a junk saver so maybe he had to

build him a little it lives right

there here's a side cut a roof on his

shed don't want him don't he sure to get

full of snow it'll touch you some

highlight out here very touching we need

some boards on that too okay lately

once again you can cut it off tell you

what let's do let's just let's put in a

window right here there's one arizona

looks like two big guys don't take a

little bit of kid yellow i will just

make the indication that maybe

somebody's home the lights are on there

that easy you take a little touch of the

liquid black and just go right around

these that easy make them stand out

there we go there we know somebody's

home okay let's go back to her fan brush

and we can begin coming right in here

bringing all this together

if you pick up a little bit of that

brownish color don't worry about it

don't worry about it it makes beautiful

shadows beautiful little shadows here

all these happy little shadows just drop

on me just sort of work back and forth

between the warm and the cool colors

just all kinds of beautiful little

things happen here let me pick up a

little bit of the brown and maybe here

and there there lives a happy little

weave here in there there yes just drop

him in lift up a little bit

and you can take a look on the snow

color just reach out of there clean up

his foots and bring them all together

okay let's get crazy

why not well i can take some brown and

some black we'll throw in some crimson

shoot even the live it up a little bit

of phthalo blue we don't care long is

this good and dark let me clean my knife

and we'll take the two inch brush and

i'm gonna go right into all that dark

color just look at there pull it wiglet

bring it back to a nice sharp sharp

chisel ditch me that good chisel edge

there it is very sharp okay let's go

back up here tell you what let's do

maybe their lives right there

a great big evergreen tree he just goes

right off the top of the canvas just use

just the corner of the brush and tap as

you work down the tree add more pressure

tap harder and harder make those

bristles bend downward may come just

bend look at that and that easy okay

they don't create our happy big tree

this is big tree and we can take another

brush and put some white on it why a

little touch of a blue there there okay

let's go back up there and let's just

put the indication of something a little

bit of snow hanging here and there don't

kill all the dark the dark is what makes

us stand out just here there

okay yeah there we can just begin

playing with some of the nice things

around here we're gonna just take a

little blue and white lift upward a

little bit and begin just bringing all

this together

see create another plane that easy that

worked right i've been there just like

so it sort of work it back and forth

they're all right now maybe maybe take

the liner brush touch of the liquid

black on it but it will stick or twig

here and there they're always sticking

up out of the snow however many you want

i'll tell you what maybe over here maybe

there's a couple over in here too like

so

drop in a few here i think that makes a

pretty nice little painting thank we'll

call that one finished in fact so from

all of us here i'd like to wish you

happy painting

god bless we'll see you next time

- hey, welcome back.

i'm certainly glad you
could join us today.

i thought today we'd do a painting,

it's very simple, i think you'll enjoy it.

let's start out and have
them run all the colors

across the screen that you'll
need to paint along with this.

while they're doing that, let me show you

what i've got up here today.

i have my plain old 18
by 24 inch double prime

pre-stretched canvas,
and i've just covered it

with a very thin coat of liquid white.

that's basically all.

we use 18 by 24 inch
canvas, but you use any size

that you like when you're doing yours.

i thought i'd start with
a little, just a little

two inch brush today.

i'm going to tap a little
bit of indian yellow into it.

don't need a lot of color,
something about like so.

let's go up in here, and maybe
right here we'll do that.

that's all there is to it.

okay, got that one
finished, it's that easy.

i'll go into a little bit of cad yellow.

same way, just use a
little two inch brush.

we don't have to even do anything,

just go around the edges
without cleaning it,

touch a little bit of yellow ochre.

there, just working the yellows out here.

a little bit more of the yellow
ochre, come right on around.

something about like that.

if you put two eyes and a
big smiley face in there,

it'd look like little orphan annie.

there we are.

okay.

sort of blend those together.

that's all we're looking for today,

something about like that.

still without cleaning
the brush, go and touch

a little bit of the alizarin crimson.

don't need a whole bunch.

and just begin blending that together.

i want to make a sky that
looks like there's a,

maybe the sun's here,
and it's shining out,

and it's a beautiful day.

we'll do this painting
mostly in brown tones.

sometimes it's gorgeous to do
paintings in just one tone.

there we are.

mmm, all right.

now, then, i want to mix up a color.

i like brown made from

sap green and alizarin crimson.

that's one of my favorite colors.

there we are, and i'm going to mix it

a little bit to the reddish side.

just a small amount.

normally we don't worry
about mixing color too well.

today, i want to mix this pretty good,

because i don't want any
green streaks up in the sky.

okay.

that ought to do it.

wipe the old knife,

then we'll go right into
that brown that we made.

there, and we'll go up in here,

and let's begin using that.

see it?

it sort of matches all this, it sort of

works together.

it's really a gorgeous brown.

all right.

and some on the other side,

just right in there.

and then we'll finish the canvas up.

we'll just use a little vandyke brown.

little bit on the other side.

and we're ready to wash the old brush.

as you know if you've
painted with me before,

that's really the fun part
of this whole procedure,

is just washing the brush.

this is the way, it's the way i get even

with everybody here in the
studio that picks on me.

all right.

 you can certainly
change the decor of a room

very rapidly if you're not careful.

i suggest when you do this at home,

you get a little device
called a brush beater rack.

it fits down in the bottom
of a waste paper basket,

it allows you to do all this without,

without ruining a happy marriage,

because you can certainly
do that in a heartbeat

if you cover the living room with paint.

i'm just blending all
these colors together,

like so.

all right, and then i'm going
to wash the brush again.

i'm really just looking for
excuses to wash the brush.

 there we are.

now then, i want to
brighten that a little more,

so i'll go right into titanium white.

we just put a little
on the two inch brush.

go right up in here.

start in the lightest area,
and begin working outward.

we want this to be the
lightest, brightest part

of this whole painting, right here.

there.

and just begin blending that outward.

now you can do this several times,

to achieve a desire lightness.

you can make it as light
or as bright as you want,

but once you get our here
in these dark colors,

i suggest that you clean the brush

before you bring it back into the center.

there we go.

something about like so.

once again, you can make it

as light as you want it
when you do your painting.

or leave it as dark as you want.

it's really an individual thing.

now, very lightly.

i just want to take out the brush strokes.

now, then.

if you want to put the indication,

knock off the excess paint,

if you want to put the
indication of a little sun,

we can do a little finger
painting right there,

and just take your finger
and make a little round sun.

those square suns sort of bother people.

make it sort of round.

of course, then, you have
to clean your finger,

and you beat it against
the easel the same way.

all right.

and just barely caress it,

and the indication of a little sun

will remain right there
in your sky, that easy.

see there?

it's all you need.

okay, let's have some fun.

we're still using the same old brush,

a little white, a little
bit of that brown color

that we made out of the sap and
the alizarin mixed together.

maybe in our world, way
back in the distance,

there's some little foothills
that live back there,

so let's do them.

all you have to do is decide
where they live in your world,

and begin tapping them in.

you know, when you paint,

tell little stories.

it makes painting easier,
it makes you understand

why things work in your painting.

shoot, sometimes i get carried away and

maybe talk about the old
trapper that lived in the woods,

maybe fell in the river,
just crazy things like that.

but it gives you a reason
for that old, abandoned cabin

being there, or something like that.

but make up little stories.

i know, i know, you're going to say your

friends and relatives will sort of

laugh at you, standing around
talking to yourself painting,

but that's okay.

that's okay.

now, then.

i'm going to lift gently upward,

just to make it look like
little trees are growing

on those hills, far away.

short, little strokes,
tiny, little strokes.

there.

just a little bit, don't need a lot.

just a little bit.

there we are.

maybe i'll even take a
little of the titanium white,

i'm going to put the least
little touch of indian yelllow

in it, and just here and there,

touch it a little bit, so
it just stands out a little.

you can lighten it up a little.

there, lift upward.

but that's all i'm looking for,

just enough to make it
stand out, like the light's

zinging across there.

there.

that's all we want.

okay.

now, we'll use this little
number three fan brush,

take a little white, a
little more of that brown.

i want to be a little bit darker
than what we have up there,

but not a great deal yet.

all right, let's go up in here,

maybe there's a little stand of trees

that live right here.

little group of trees.

happy little family of trees, right there.

i don't know, you decide.

in your world, you put trees
wherever you want them,

as many as you want.

there, see?

and we can come back with
our old two-inch brush,

and we just tap a little bit.

that easy.

and create a whole other
plane in our world.

i'm going to lift up,
sort of bring it together,

make it work.

that's all there is to it.

and back to our white, with a little bit

of the indian yellow in it,

and we can begin just
showing some little dooders

that climb up the hill like this.

this'll just show different
planes in your hill,

and that's all we're trying to do,

something about like that, lift it up.

there.

and maybe over in here, it
just sort of disappears.

we don't know where it goes.

don't know that we even care.

doesn't matter.

i'm just going to cover all this up

with that nice brown we made.

there.

as i say, i want this painting to have a

sort of a brown flavor to it.

i love this color,

and i like paintings that
are almost monochromatic,

just one basic color.

all right.

i'll tell you what, sometimes,

sometimes you have to get a little crazy.

let's take a little bit of that white,

and get a little roll of paint,

right on the edge of the knife there.

let's go up in here, and maybe

we'll just make the indication,

just by doing this,
that's all you have to do.

just like this, just enough
so that it separates,

and we can begin putting
little things like that.

if you just rub that very hard,

and keep it pretty level,
when this is all done,

it'll look like,

well, watch, it'll look like there's a,

maybe a little river
back in here somewhere.

but it's far away.

we don't want a lot of detail in it.

far, far away.

just something like that.

and we'll come along, and we'll

put something in the foreground,

but maybe there's some
little rapids back here

that are slowly running over.

and it's just to give an indication.

too far away to have
a lot of detail in it.

all right.

we don't know where it goes back here,

don't know that we even care.

doesn't matter in our world.

something about like that.

okay, now.

i'm going to grab a clean,

clean two inch brush.

i'm going to take that
same brown that i made,

but this time i'm going
to add a little bit of

midnight black to it.

i want to start getting very dark.

we're getting into the foreground now,

and we need to get much darker.

but we load it the same
way, scooping here.

okay, bravery test.

maybe.

let's put some nice, dark color in here.

very dark.

you need dark in order to show light,

and that's all we're putting
this in here for right now.

the only reason we're putting it in here.

there, we'll just make a nice little hill.

see, and it pushes all
that back very, very far.

that easy.

and you can just decide
where you want this to live.

now, you could really
put this in any old way.

i suggest you practice this tapping,

because we're going to
put grass on top of this,

and it gives you a chance
to practice those strokes,

and anytime you can practice,

it'll make your life so much easier,

and besides that, it's more fun than just

painting it on there with a paint roller.

all right.

that's coming along pretty good there.

something about like that.

that's really all we're looking for,

it's just a dark area.

then we'll come back,

begin putting all the beautiful
little lights in there.

all right.

this is interesting,
this is the 30th series

of "the joy of painting."

shoot, there's nearly 400 shows now.

if you hadn't got a chance
to see them all in your area,

give the station you're
watching this on a call,

because they're available to them,

and if you'd like to
see them, let them know.

that's the only way they
know that you're interested.

there we go.

something about like that.

now, then.

going back to my old two inch brush.

i'm going to take some sap green,

a little bit of the cad
yellow, yellow ochre,

all those beautiful
little colors, just tap.

now, then.

back in here, i want the indication

of a little bit of grass area,

that lives right along in here.

something about like that, but just tap.

all you have to do is tap.

just tap.

you decide.

about like that.

see how you can make
all those little things?

and the more you tap
it, the more it'll mix

with the color that's
already on the canvas,

and it'll get darker and
darker automatically.

automatically.

you don't even have to worry about it.

if you want it to be
bright, don't tap much.

if you want it to be darker,
just get in there and

tap the devil out of it.

there.

all right.

now, let's get crazy. 

you've painted with me before,

you know i really like trees.

let's take some vandyke
brown, alizarin crimson,

and midnight black, and mix them together.

all right.

let me wipe the old knife.

let's grab, i'm using a number
six fan brush this time.

number three would work
okay, doesn't matter.

whichever one you happen to pick up.

load it full of color.

maybe up here on the
top of our little hill,

lives, yeah, you guessed
it, a happy little tree,

right there.

i like little trees.

they're some of the nicest
people in the country.

there, see?

there he lives.

i don't want him to be lonely.

maybe there's a little family
up here that lives together.

what a magnificent view to set
up here and look at all day.

mmm, i'm envious.

we'll even have a little one right there,

then we got a whole family.

three little trees on the hill.

now, then.

i just want to scratch in the indication

of a little tree trunk here and there,

something about like that.

that's all we need.

take that same brown color,

maybe add a little bit
of the bright red to it.

not much, just a little bright red.

there, maybe even a little
touch of titanium white,

just to get it to stand out a little bit.

i don't want a lot of highlights on these.

yeah, that's plenty.

just enough so that you get the feeling

there are some highlights.

but they don't distract.

there, this one next.

you have to decide which
tree lives in the foreground,

which tree lives back.

i think this one's right in the front.

so we do him last, so he's in front.

hope that shows up.

now, we can go back to our
brush that has that sap green,

a little indian yellow, all those colors.

all the different greens, so we can begin

bringing this together.

a few little dooders back there.

but isn't that neat?

see, got a little family
of trees that sit here.

they look out over this beautiful view.

mmm, it is gorgeous.

i'd like to live in a place,

well, i'll tell you what, why not?

if i was going to live
here, i'd need a house.

i'm not very good at sleeping on the dirt.

so, let's come right up in here,

and let's build us a little,

maybe it was a little house there.

we'll just scrape us out a basic shape,

something like so.

i want it right in front of these trees.

we'll take a little vandyke,
a little dark sienna

mixed together, and
let's just paint this in.

a quick little house.

this is just a happy little
house up here on a hill.

like that.

there.

gives us a nice roof.

got to have a roof to keep the water out.

there we go, something like that.

now, when you do yours, maybe
you want to have a house

that's different, maybe you
don't want to have a house.

maybe you want to have a two story house.

you can do that.

anything that you want to do.

painting gives one almost total freedom,

at least on this piece of canvas.

a little brown and white,

no pressure.

i want this to be sort
of an old, raggedy house.

there.

as we mentioned earlier,
doing stories and stuff,

maybe there's a trapper that lived here,

and he went down to the river one day

to check his beaver trap,
and maybe he fell in.

who knows?

now we can do a cabin-ectomy.

in other words, just cut it off.

get it the way we want it.

better have a door in our cabin.

it's easier to get in and
out if you got a door.

it's hard climbing through
the window sometimes.

here we go.

take a little dark color,

put the indication of a few
boards and stuff on there

if you want them.

and you could have made
a log cabin just as easy.

let's take a little red,a little white,

a little dark sienna in it.

let's see, maybe,

yeah, why not?

maybe this has got
little red roof on there.

it's not in too good a shape either.

not in too good a shape, the
whole shingle's about fell off,

it's got some holes in it.

yeah, a few little highlights,
right up here on top

where the sun's really
zinging across the top.

a few little dooders down the side here,

so it stands out.

there.

got us a little cabin.

all right, now we can go back to our

brush with a grass color on it,

and we can begin putting
in all kinds of little

grassy areas like this,

right up here by the trees.

these trees remind me
of my little squirrel.

what'd be a good place for him to live?

i want to show you my little
squirrel one more time.

shoot, i've showed him
to you a couple of times

in this series.

he's one of the cutest little
devils that you've ever seen.

he's pea pod junior.

he likes to live in my pocket.

of course, by the time
you get to see this,

he'll already be turned
lose, and he'll be free,

probably living in my backyard, and

he'll have a little condo
back there in a tree.

i love these little old rascals.

i raise a bunch of them
every year, turn them lose,

and they go back to nature,
where they're supposed to be.

hope you enjoy seeing
those little rascals,

they're really special to me, and

i like to share them with my friends.

all right, maybe over in here,

okay, i see a thing happening here,

it's a place for a path, right there.

yeah, yeah, yeah, i see it.

as you, , i'm
sorry to get excited,

as you paint, you begin
seeing things here.

they just sort of happen.

watch here, watch here.

we take a little brown, a
little brown, and maybe,

you see the indication of a
little path coming out here,

maybe sort of disappears, comes out here,

around.

it just, these things happen.

don't fight them when they happen.

very quickly, you'll learn
to use anything that happens

in your painting, and it might make

some of the most interesting compositions.

a little bit of brown and white,

just a small amount, and
we can highlight a little,

just so it stands out here and there.

all right.

tell you what we need here.

let me find a liner brush.

take a little paint thinner,

and we need a few little
sticks and twigs that live

right along in here.

maybe, maybe even

something on out in here,

old stick that lives there.

might've been a little tree there that

didn't have such a good time,
things got rough on him.

okay, let's get crazy.

we've got a minute left here.

take a little bit of the midnight black,

vandyke brown mixed together.

all right, bravery test.

here it comes.



got to make those little weird noises.

we got a happy little tree
that lives right there,

and he's got a friend, too.

see?

now we got two little
trees that live there.

now let's go back to our liner brush.

need the paint thinner
though, to make the paint

very thin, so it'll literally flow

right over the top of the paint
that's already on the cavas.

turn the bristles in there.

that brings it to a very sharp point.

there, you can see it?

see, just turn them, like that.

now,

now, if it's thin enough, it'll just flow

right over the top of that paint,

without mixing together.

about like that,

and you can put in all kinds
of little arms on your trees.

just wherever you want them.

you have to decide though, like,

which one's in front?

which one's behind?

these are decisions that
you make in your own world.

gives you a lot of power, doesn't it?

there we are.

okay.

you know, every day we get letters from

fantastic friends all over the country

who are picking up their
brush and trying this,

and they're saying, "you
told me i could do it,

and i never believed it until i tried.

now i have my whole family painting."

that's so wonderful, when families

do things together,
because this is something

you can do with your spouse,

with your children,
with friends, neighbors,

or even people you want to be your friend.

it's a good way to meet new people,

because people who paint just seem to be

some of the nicest people.

there we are.

all kinds of little dooders.

and you decide, once again.

you must make these decisions.

we don't want to tell you how many limbs

to put on your tree, or even

what kind of tree to paint,

because painting is a
very individual thing.

there.

i'm going to take a little white,

a little bit of the midnight black,

paint thinner,

just mix them together a little bit,

black and white,

or white and black,

and i'm going to come right along here,

put a little highlight right
on the side of that tree.

there.

if the sun's up here, zing.

just to make him a little
sparkler on the side there.

something about like that.

all right, go back to our brush that's

got the sap green and
all the yellows on it.

tap a little color.

and let's just clean up the
bottom of its foot here,

bring all that together.

maybe, maybe there's a little

baby tree down here.

he's going to take over one day.

one day, he'll be the big tree,

but now he's just a little baby,

and i think with that,

shoot, we've about got
a finished painting.

take a little paint thinner, a
little bit of the bright red,

and let's sign this little rascal.

really hope you've enjoyed
this little painting.

it's a very simple little painting.

it'll work for you.

if you have time, take a
photograph and send to us.

all of us here at the
station would love to see

what you're doing.

so, until then, from all of us here,

i'd like to wish you happy painting,

and god bless, my friend.



hey welcome back certainly glad you

could spend a little time with us today

and do a fantastic little painting so i

tell you what let's get started haven't

run all the colors across the screen

that you need to paint along with me and

they'll come across in the same orders i

have them on the palette starting with

the white and working around today as

you can plainly see i have a black

canvas up here and i've just covered

this with black gesso allowed it to dry

completely and then on top of that i've

added a mixture of midnight black and a

little bit of prussian blue

not much pression blue just enough to

give it a little bluish tint and i

thought they would do a little mountain

winter scene something let's just do it

and see what happens okay start off with

the old two-inch brush today go right

into a small amount of titanium white as

i've mentioned before these black

canvases are fantastic if you want to if

you want atma's friends and relatives

and etc because they don't see you put

the color on top of the black it is

transparent and then when you come in

here and you add a little bit of white

just all kinds of beautiful little

things just happen and today i just want

to add a very small amount of the

titanium white just to get the

indication of a little color here and

there don't want a lot of color today

just a little i will put some clouds i

think in here so all i'm looking for is

just a little background color this one

this is behind the clouds you'll do that

first any will come in with drop in a

happy little cloud here and there

i like these black canvases because a

little bit of color shows up so strong

and so beautiful it just it sounded real

what you can do with them

you know i get letters from people every

day and they send me photographs of the

paintings that they're doing at home and

these black canvases maybe some of the

favorites and these are from people that

a lot of them have never had they've

never even suspected they had any art

talent they've never had any lessons

they just watch the shows picked up

ideas got enough confidence grab the old

brush and they're doing some beautiful

paintings and you can too you really can

let's wash the brush shake it up beat

the devil out of it

all right let's get us a 1 inch brush if

we're going to have a happy little cloud

we'll just continue to use the titanium

white just pull a little color into the

bristles now we have to make our first

major decision here where does our low

clouds live in our world

maybe yep you're right there he is i'm

just using that top corner of the brush

and just making tiny little circles just

tiny little circles tiny little circles

there you go this is saying along as you

as you're doing this think about tiny

little circles there you go okay and

blend it out look at that let's look how

color stands out on this black canvas

it's unreal it's unreal maybe there's

another little cloud he just floats

around right here whatever wherever

there we are

okay maybe a little more of the color

maybe yeah you're right

let's have another clad this this will

give us a little bit of practice doing

some happy little clouds they're a lot

of fun a lot of fun and they're very

easy to do very easy to do

maybe he comes right on we don't know

where it goes here a little fluffer

there clouds are so free so free they're

just one of the freest things in nature

maybe it comes out through here there

where's the job i want my next life only

come back get cloud and just float

around have a good time older maintain

out take a large brush and i'm very

gently just begin beginning to blend the

base of this very lightly jesus blended

blended blending once again color shows

up so much stronger on the black

canvases much stronger than on a white

canvas there we go you can blend these

till they're dead so don't overdo it

just blend just enough to stir them up a

little bit mix about their a little bit

right in there now i beat the brush just

to remove excess paint off of it so i

don't have to clean it again then i'm

going to fluff them let them tease of

pull them this is not not a very firm

pressure on applying that just gentle

just gentle just enough to grab it move

it a little bit and very lightly very

lightly

look at that look at that i had some

fantastic little cloud look there they

stand out once again so strong from

these black canvases this black gesso is

one of the most fantastic things years

ago i used to just use black house paint

listen i've had some letters and people

they wrote and told me that didn't do

too well so the black gesso is designed

specifically for this hmm okay let's

build us a mountain let's build us a

mountain today i'm going to use just

black and vendek very own little

prussian blue we'll throw some alizarin

crimson in there too what the heck

looking for a color that looks very dark

looks black okay cut off a little roll

of paint have it right on the edge of

the knife and then you have to make a

major decision where did your mountain

live in your world i think he's going to

live over here so let's go right up in

here and let's just drop us in a nice

big mountain nice big nut i like i like

to do mountains because it gives you

gives you a lot of experience with a

knife once you learn how to do mountains

with this knife oh it's your friend you

can do anything

maybe this comes over here and there's

another peak lives right there wherever

you want there if you can do mountains

with this knife you can do off just do

rocks stones and roads and buildings and

some of the past series we've done

entire paintings using nothing but the

knife absolutely nothing but tonight

we'll have to do some more of those type

shows it's interesting to see why can be

done just using a knife it's a little

difficult because of the time restraints

there we go now i'm just using a two

inch brush i just want to pull this down

this is an excellent way of laying out

highlights and shadows you can see those

brushstrokes in there every stroke you

make it stands out i hope you can see

those on you on your tv set but you can

lay out entire mountains just just using

the brush strokes and you're not

committed you can change it free feeted

lee literally hundreds of times but it

teaches you how to how to make your

mountain look the way you want it to

look there so we just can carry away

make all kinds of beautiful effects okay

let's put some snow on that mountain for

that i'm going to use titanium white and

put a little bit of black with it just

to dull it down just a dollar so it's

not pure white pull the paint out firmly

just really get in there and raise the

devil with it and then cut us off a

little roll of pain again you want that

to be right on the edge of the knife

okay

now that no pressure just let it touch

the canvas and gray's all this touching

is that roller paint it just grazes the

canvas

graze it and caress it there make good

friends with it look at that that the

paint break and work for you we have a

very firm paint and it's designed

specifically for this technique and it

works so well but you need a very firm

dry paint most most important now you

have to make some big decisions where

does these peaks live are they in the

background in the foreground we'll put

this one in the foreground like so here

we are just let them go or everyone

think about where the light would strike

keawe takes a light use some pression

blue prussian blue some black looking

for a gray blue color

sort of a grayish blue that's not bad

something like so once again our little

roll of paint now we can come back in

here and we can begin playing in all

cancelin shadows just follow the lay of

the mountain here say here comes one to

me looks like there's a valley right in

there so just pull it create that

illusion the illusion

there now they don't see that peak right

there i want to push it back watch here

right here you might have seen me do

this before

but it's always fun just come directly

distinctly through that and it pushes

that son-of-a-gun right on the back and

here i'm going to leave that dark so it

looks like our nice recessed area leave

some dark in there times there we go

here's a nice one and here and there

there's one you can put the indication

of shadows and it causes like little

ridges and all kinds of beautiful little

effects very simply there we go change

that let that go where we want to but

practice these mountains it will open

whole new worlds for you once you learn

to to make friends with this knife get a

little more of the titanium white with a

touch of black in it so without flat

once again our little rule of paint i

want to put a few highlights over here

on this little mountain

this reminds me of my home in alaska

where god was having a good day when he

made alaska so beautiful if you've never

been there your your to go see it while

it's still wild you can see more

creatures there in one day so beautiful

my favorite uncle sent me there

uncle sam you know he he asked me if i'd

like to go up there for a while and if

you don't go you're going to jail

you know how i'll say i'm ask you to go

but i went up there and i fell in love

with a crazy place it is so spectacular

i was born and raised in florida i

didn't know that things like that even

existed i've never dreamed of there no

pressure

want that paint to break creats all of

those beautiful little effects just sort

of bring that together right in there

like like a little valley lives now

little mountain goat has to have a place

to go hide now then we'll take we'll

take two-inch brush and very lightly

will begin tapping always following the

angles in the mountain now i'm going to

have snow down here so it doesn't matter

if we get a little paint down here we're

going to cover it all up so don't be

worried about it don't be worried about

over here we want to follow these angles

look at the angles in your mountain and

follow them want to create that illusion

of mist beat the brush to remove excess

paint now maybe right in here

sometimes you can very gently just blend

things together here see just blend them

together it'll make it look like it's a

little misty or you're laying right

between those there bring it right on

down now very lightly two hairs and some

air grab that and lift upward gently

lift upward upward upward there over

here

follow these ankles lift it upward now

you're just lifting right in here you

don't want to lift and destroy all these

just diffuse the bottom of the mountain

so it looks like it's sitting right

there right in mist okay we wash your

sole brush give him a good scrub shake

him up cover cup of cameraman and

wearing business business

all right let's use the same old dark

color here we had some black some

prussian blue some van dyck brown

blizzard crimson doesn't matter there's

some dark sienna we can throw that in

there whatever you have well there when

we clean the knife let's grab us a fan

brush here there

and i'm going to load it full of this

dark color that we just made full of

color a lot of paint and back in here

back in here we're going to have some

little evergreen trees that are far away

now they'll stand out against that

lighter mountain color maybe they come

down there we go

and what this just to be straight so i'm

gonna have it go uphill here a little

bit so we have some we have some

variation in our in our land make him

look a little more a little more

interesting if it goes every which way

there maybe comes right i don't up here

i don't know wherever you want it

wherever you want

i help push all those mountains back but

you need that little misty area in

between a little mystery is your

separator it keeps it keeps the

mountains and the trees apart i'm gonna

put a little bit of that shadow color

head left here and just lift up worthy

to create the the illusion a little

distant tree trunks i want this very

subdued very quiet see just shows up

good that's all now if you get one

that's too bright you don't like it all

you have to do is continue to rub it and

it'll go away it'll go away

now maybe back here true let's have some

fun

a lot of paint a lot of paint what a

messy brush i got there look at that son

of again i got paint all the way up to

the furrow that's okay

maybe back in here there lives a few

trees are closer to us and they're big

and they're strong there they are

see now if you have problems making your

paint stick over this mountain because

it's there's a lot of paint back here

add some paint thinner to your dark i'm

doing all right right here today but

sometimes you have a little problem if

that occurs just add a little thinner

because a thin paint will stick on top

of a thicker paint there and i do

realize that happens sometime people

write and tell me that they're having

some problems usually if you just add a

little paint thinner that'll cure there

you don't mention before we travel all

over the country we give painting

demonstrations and work with pbs

stations and other charity groups around

the country to help we'll make a happy

buck or two and if we get to your area

come see us shoot i'd love to have the

opportunity to meet you and talk with

you i've met with literally thousands of

people it's it's fantastic they bring

photographs of their paintings in sound

real what people are doing and if you'd

like to know what i'm going to be in

your area drop me a line just put your

name and address on my card and send it

to the address at the end of the station

they'll send it to me we maintain a

little mailing list amell i'll try to

drop your card and let you know who

we're going to be in your area well we

got a whole mess of trees going there

and then it's going to take a knife

just hearing here i know those are hard

to see but there's little lines in there

we need to brighten this picture up i'll

put some snow in it that'll that'll zing

it you find a big brush okay let's get

serious we write into titanium white now

we have color on the canvas already we

have a blue and black mixture so hungry

when we put color on get a little less

shadow color too and we put color on

there it's going to get a little darker

than what we have on the brush and we're

depending on that okay got to make a big

decision towards you snow live let's say

soon goes right let's go uphill down

likes dancing or i know you saying bobby

made a mess this time you may be right

too i've certainly been known to do this

there we go

but we don't we don't make mistakes you

don't we have happy accidents very soon

very soon if you start painting in this

method you'll learn that there's nothing

that goes wrong and correct anything it

happens one of the things when i was

teaching classes continually that's so

good and if you were teaching this will

help you with students is if you sure

that they're there are no mistakes you

can fix everything it happens and that

really helps get you over some of that

fear well we have a lot of fear we first

touch a big old blank canvas once you

once you get over that that's when

you're really really beginning

experience enjoy a pain

there see there that's quickly well we

get a whole snow bank in there just like

so okay weirdin brush go there it is

let's have an evergreen on the other

side same old color same ol color i'm

really loading that brush full of color

a lot of paint both sides alright maybe

it is a tree that lives in our world yep

right there all right there here he

comes

there kind of just work back and forth

making the bristles bend downward as you

work down a tree get stronger and

stronger and more and more pressure

i commend more it makes those little

things that hang under the limbs little

i call them hang you downs for lack of a

better word but they're always an

evergreen trees those little hanging

down thanks there see how this one's

closer to us and by putting trees in

different places that once again helps

create that illusion of distance though

having a little friend right there

okay now that we can reach up under here

grab some of that dark and pull it down

that creates our shadow under our tree

fixes the bottom of the tree calls one

stroke and then i'm going to take some

white and a little bit of phthalo blue i

like a phthalo blue it's a brighter blue

nice bright blue okay maybe there's a

happy little a little path need a little

more blue doesn't show up enough you see

it well there see just a little path and

lives right in there

there yes that blue makes it cold but

table blue so quite warm it's a nice

blue and here and there you can bring

some little things down the fan brush

you can really get in there and smooth

things out put little individual things

and blend them just make all kinds of

happy little things going on i'll tell

you what this is a nice place for a

little building

let's have maybe right back here against

these trees come right up here so we can

i'm gonna scrape out a basic shape just

take the knife scrape out a basic idea

of what it is that you want here just

scrape it out there we go see still not

committed at that point are you doing

just scrape it out okay take some white

let's put a roof on there need a roof

now here's a little trick so you can

come down that edge get all your lines

nice and straight and when you pull this

down then you'll have a beautiful

straight edge sneaky huh there we go now

we need a little bit of snow on the

other side of the roof over here just

like it get into some van dyke brown

there we are

see there we putting in all we're doing

is blocking in some color they're just

blocking it in

now we'll take some dark sienna that's

some white very gently very gently just

pull straight down make us a nice boards

there

add a little van dyke brown to that

darken it down a little more there yeah

we can just whack off the bottom get it

the way we want it you know what time

maybe i'll tell you what let's go right

up in here excuse marvin just a second

you can see that i will put some little

things like it then we go right up here

on the top a little little bit of

winning maybe we'll just take and turn

this into a little church this lives out

here but a little steeple right up there

just all covered with snow boy it's

really cold out here

there the snow laying all up around

there yeah maybe tell you what let's do

this maybe getting ready for a service

they've turned they turned lights on

here they've got the lights burning in

the windows so let's just creep out the

indication of some happy little windows

won't take a little bit of cad yellow

just put in in the case of a little

light coming through those windows there

people gonna be arriving pretty soon

cold a cold day okay back to my fan

brush here that in this put some snow

right up around the foot here i can't

okay maybe tell you what maybe right

here in the foreground let's just put a

little treat and is right there hair is

give him a little friend or two

just want to put a little something here

it'll push everything back and that

helps create that illusion of distance

in your painting a little bit up a

little bit of shadow underneath should i

think with that have a a finished

painting hope this gives you some ideas

shows you what can be done black canvas

hope you enjoy our little church in the

in the snow from all of us here happy

painting and god bless

you

oh

you

right glad you could join me today today

i thought we'd do a nice beautiful

little winter scene it's sort of warm

and has a beautiful little glue and i

think it will make you happy so let's

have them start off and run all the

colors across the screen that you need

to do this painting and they'll come

across in the same order as i have a

moment palette now i've already covered

the canvas with it then even co2 the

liquid white it's wet and slick it's all

ready to go let's have some fun start

today with a little one-inch brush going

to a little bit of cad yellow the

tiniest tiniest little amount of the

bright red tiny little milk can't say

that enough just work a little bit into

the bristles go ahead up here i'm gonna

have a son in this painting so you'll

have the sun right about there and we

start off just making a little circle so

you got to do like so okay now i'm going

to wash the brush now we wash our

brushes and odourless thinner just beat

the devil out of it okay now then i'm

gonna go into titanium white and will

come right down here and get a little

touch of alizarin crimson just like so

okay ask her right up in here and we'll

work this in using a little little

crisscross strokes a little excess if

you use these little crisscross strokes

rather than draw on a big circle it's

much much easier to blend all of these

colors together i'd really recommend to

use these little strokes

like so maybe i'll add the least little

touch of crimson here and make it a

little bit brighter so you can see it

better on you said anytime some of these

colors are so soft it's hard to see

we'll bring it right on out like it

normally when we're doing these

paintings for television be painting a

little brighter then we would at home so

when you're painting at home you paint

in any way that makes you happy bring it

right on down like that okay

i'm gonna go to a two inch brush it's a

little bit faster now go right into the

crimson tiniest little bit tiny little

bit and now i'm going to add just a

small amount of the dark sienna

to the crimson make a very warm brown

case go back up here yeah very lightly

right around here still making the

little crisscross strokes very soft

quiet gentle little sky but very

effective very effective this is a tight

painting that people put in their living

rooms just make it look warm they're

good sellers if you're interested in

selling things so many people write and

tell me that they're selling paintings

at the ending they believe they could

paint what that really makes me happy

when people write and tell me that and

it's not the money the money is not

important it's what it does to your ego

and inside here because if somebody's

willing to pay you for something you

paint it with your hand then i'll makes

you want to go home and paint ten more

paintings that's what's important it's

not the money going right into van dyke

brown sometimes i talk too much i have

to hush get excited

van dyck brown still making a little

crisscross now this is mixing with the

liquid white and all of these beautiful

little things just happen a little bit

more of the brown and right there looks

just like an egg i cook this morning bad

news

i'm not much of a cook i'll take just

lay a little tiny bit of this brownish

color down in here and without him

cleaning the brush the least little

touch of a little blue tiny tiny little

amount okay it will just lay out a

little bit of that just hear it just

hearing there and you can add other

alizarin crimson i'm just putting some

colors down here don't worry about

blending them together or mixing them at

this point

alright let's lay that brush down and i

have several these two inch brushes

going and i'm going to go right up here

and again blending still use the little

crisscross strokes and you really want

to blend this out just blend it blend it

blend it working outward and you don't

want to bring the dark color in toward

the center blend it out right there

and you want to blend this till you

can't tell where one color stops and the

next one starts very soft very gentle

then very lightly just take out the

brushstrokes if you happen to get a hair

on the canvas like i did there just take

the corner of the brush and pop it off

it's obvious to you now there now let's

have some fun we'll put a sun up in here

and for that i'm gonna use my finger

let's go right here take a little white

and i'm just gonna rub it right in just

make a little circle sun looks a little

better if it's round m square sun sort

of bother you there you go see you just

push that right in there make a little

circle now if you tried blending that it

would smear so take your knife come

right up here and watch take your knife

and just go hoop take it right off the

value or the color remains in the canvas

now you can come along here let's see

you can blend that and that easy and

easy you have a happy little side

alright and that completes our sky now

we can have some fun and begin painting

now you have to make a decision here

okay i'm going to use the round brush go

into van dyck brown little dark sienna

i'm just going to mix them on the brush

just tap it see just happen there we go

let's go ahead up here

maybe there's a happy little tree that

lives right here then we'll start at the

base of this tree and work upwards so

automatically automatically it's going

to mix with a liquid white and it's

going to be darker at the bottom and it

is on the top and you have your shadows

without even trying darker darker darker

down toward the bottom

maybe there's a happy little tree or

bush it lives there begin thinking about

the lay of the land or the way the

ground flows i'm going to have a little

hill here so that's what i'm again

working on we're not worried a great

deal about detail at this point but

already interested in is a general lay

of the land oh there's another one so

you just put these little things just

sort of fall out of your brush they live

in there sometimes you have to tap them

out a little bit but they live in there

we go and we'll pull a little bit of

that color down just the bottom because

that'll end up being our shadows in the

snow so you use all these things where

you get so dark color on the brush you

can use it now then i'm going to take a

little bit of a liquid black out here on

my pallet take my liner brush add a

little paint thinner and then work out

brush in there and turn it turn it

bring it to a super sharp point look at

that very sharp all right now that in

here in here but just the indication of

a few little trunks little stems

whatever you want to call them leones

arms whatever okay now one of the

questions i get asked a great deal is do

you pull it down or you go up it doesn't

matter try it both ways and most people

will find it works better one way than

it does the other now normally i pull

down because it's easier for you to see

it that way when i'm painting at home a

lot of times i'll pull up i don't think

there's any rule you just sort of

practice and find which way works for

you there we try to show you as many

ways as possible and turn you loose on

the world

okay now then we'll take the round brush

and dip it right into a little touch of

the liquid white just a little touch i'm

going to add the least least little

touch of bright red here to tie her

knees a little bit tap that brush tap it

tap it tap it can't go up here now then

let's put some beautiful little

highlights up here on these trees just

use just the top corner of the brush and

we can tap in here see there but think

about shapes in here don't just throw

this on it random leave some of those

nice dark areas in here see the patterns

that's what gives you tree shape and

form now if you have trouble making it

stick add a little bit more the liquid

white to it i'll put a little more red

in there want to stand out a little here

we go there we go beautiful you can see

that much better thing okay just go

right along here and make some decisions

how many trees how many bushes oops

there's whatever writer c layer that

creates depth this is where the little

bunny rabbit hides is behind that bush

and then up here all winter long the

little tree urchin stays i bet you

wonder what a tree your chin is that's

what i call a little squirrel i have a

big walnut tree in my yard and the

little squirrels come and they eat

walnuts and we have little little power

struggles over who's going to get to all

nuts be at a squirrel guess who wins

squirrels got a nest full of nuts and i

have none right up here

there i've got one in little rascals it

decided he liked my garage better to eat

it out during a cold he moved into my

garage can you get that little devil out

so i put some mothballs in his nest dad

stinks

there now once again while i have this

on my brush i'm going to begin pulling

in some basic shapes and i'm not worried

at this point about much of anything

except the lay of the lamp

just pull it in just like so all right

now then we can take the old fan brush

the old fan brush with a little quiet on

it and we can begin working on some nice

shapes and stuff here this is where

again laying in the snow and you can go

into a tiny little bit of the pale blue

and add shadows it doesn't matter fact

it's desirable if you pick up a little

bit of this brown and begin working it

in here here we go always always paying

attention to the lay of the land and

thank where the light would hit snow is

very really really smooth it has little

bumps colors rocks and stones and all

kinds of little happy things that are

underneath the snow you may not see them

but they they cause bumps into snow okay

maybe tell you why let's go right here

and push in there there's a happy little

little grassy area just runs right down

the hill see there just make all kinds

of little things happen here all right i

like to do these little winter scenes

are a lot of fun i've fun and it easy

let's make you happy okay tell you what

tell you what maybe years ago a old

trapper

maybe he built him a little little house

right there so it takes them some of the

van dyck brown cut across and get a

little roll of paint on the knife

there you see right out of the edge is

most importance right out on the edge of

the knife let's go up here okay maybe

the little house lives does now right

there there it is see paint that little

back you first i tell you what to put a

frightening little food fried on the

other side

see just sort of in your mind think

think what a house looks like and he

needs a little side over here too

all right man take a little quiet a

little brown

i was hot very flat get us a little roll

of paint and that's let's put a nice

little touch of highlight on there

barely touching very touching just

caress the canvas okay now see we can

see that the lights coming from here so

this sites going to be a brighter this

one over here this one's going to be

almost dark almost pure brown don't

worry about too much color over that say

for that guy liz and there is freezing

because there is no roof of his house

let's give him a roof

let's give him a roof there we go just

that easy man he's got a half a roof

let's feel sorry for him getting about a

half don't want him to freeze okay

little snow on the other side just sort

of bring all that together

and that easy she got a cabin needed or

don't get locked in there and keen get

out all wed her there you got a little

door take a little white go around edges

they're making rascal stand down we'll

take the small knife now we'll put a

little window right there just a little

blue and white just give the indication

of a happy little window like that okay

whoa chimney we use a small edge of the

small knife or you put a little chimney

take a little tiny little touch of the

bright red skews mahram there maybe he

don't have his fireplace let a little

snow laying up here on his chimney there

we go that easy until you one take a

little bit of liquid black maybe there's

what remains of an old fence and it went

right off here this is just straight

liquid black there it goes and there's a

fuel rails left on it right off into the

distance and then need to do to dirt

with

wash the brush now take a little bit of

the liquid white help look at their

little snow laying up here on his fins

and a little up here on top there think

and you just make all kinds of little

things we take the fan brush and grab

just a touch of that flame to death all

right now we can fix up the foot of this

cabin take and work on your perspective

look at there you can just cut it right

off wherever you want it ever you wanna

take a little white little touch it blew

into it i come right on here and there's

a big ol bunch of snow laying right

along there maybe even create the

illusion he's been walking right here

this using the little tiny tiny bit of a

little blue white and we go back to her

paint her colors it's got a little pink

in there begin building all this in

still paint very close attention to the

lay of the land its most most important

that you always keep in mind the way you

want this i am the flow if you don't

they will get away from you run right

out of your pay t pretty soon you had

land going in every which direction so

pay attention to that that's it's

important so little details that make

you make your paintings better make you

happier when you get done with your

painting

it's nice to step back and look at it

and feel good about it you want to feel

good about it

despite their back you see they get a

little larger down here cause

perspective wise

let's get them closer to you all right

all right leave out one side done here

fine okay let's get serious

let's get serious final round brush here

let's put something over here on the

other side have some fun back into my

dark sienna and like round tap petal

brush in there so you really beat that

son of a gun this is where you take out

all your frustrations is it better than

kicking your dog of course fees like

mine you're kicking he'll take your leg

off there we go right

work it up see once again we're starting

from the bottom i've been working up for

10 so it's darker to bottom and it is on

top maybe that ends right up into there

mmm i like these very salt earth tones

browns and stuff you're so striking so

effective there we go

maybe two but right there very tan tell

you what i must do we get just so brush

go into so much fun let's go right over

on this side

and maybe right here i'm just gonna push

upward see just push look at all the

thousands of little leaves and stuff it

makes their and that easy it looks like

a dead bush there's one right there -

we'll have a couple of these little

rascals

just drop them in wherever you want them

and you take a the old fan brush you go

right back in here and we can working

some of these out create all kinds of

pretty things so you can make make the

lay of the land go anywhere you want to

go wherever see mike all kind of little

snowdrifts up there sometimes it's just

so pretty it hurts okay

and let's let's change let's change the

flow of the lay on here the lay that i

watch right here see take it this way

and bring it up in here automatically

grab some of that brown pull it down in

there automatically you can change the

lay of the land so that you can see

there's a separate entity here it goes

back father pushes everything back okay

yeah then let's take i'll use the old

knife here let's just put a quick little

indication here of a little tree trunk

it doupe doupe doupe it's like that few

little leone's here in there little

brown and white a little highlight just

a tiny touch of highlight you take just

a pointed knife look at there straight

through and make all kinds of little

doers in there little valves and stones

and twigs it's that easy okay

yeah then let's find that's right there

it is the round brush let's have some

fun let's get crazy here and we'll take

a little the bright red little yellow

ocher little indian yellow but very

small amount don't don't get too wild on

this very small amount okay let's go

right up here maybe this tree here got a

little bit of color on it still fall

just drop in some happy little things

once again worry about patterns shapes

think about leila's in there and i'm

just using the very top corner of the

brush just a very very top corner look

at that top see all the little things

and this creates a little warmth in the

painting um sometimes i paint winter

scenes that are so cold

who gosh you almost have to put on a

coat to look at them these are very warm

and very soft and they go well in

people's homes people like these kind of

paintings these are the type paintings i

do for special friends and as gifts for

christmas and birthdays and weddings and

all kinds of things like that brings up

another thing a lot of people ask us

what we do with all these paintings that

we do on tv most of them are used to go

into the books that we do but all the

rest of them we donate we donate them to

pbs stations all around the country into

charity organizations for them to make a

happy buck with so if you would like to

have one one of the easiest ways to get

it is to call your pbs station and say

hey you know get one of bob's paintings

for your next auction and we'll be glad

to donate one to them and it helps

everybody out you get better programming

that way in the pbs station

he puts a happy book in his pocket and

you get a you get a painting so keep

that in mind if you want one that's let

your station know just drop in a few

little blue and white grassy areas here

oh

kinds of little things going on in here

all kinds of oh thanks

man i tell you what let's use a knife

maybe that's what remains there he's an

old fence right here there's a post put

one there

tell you what three three looks better

ins a little bit of brown and white for

some highlight doop doop there we go

maybe there's still one old one old post

is hanging across there just like that

that easy okay let's have some fun let

me get an old fan brush here go right

into the van dyck brown little dark

sienna

i think yep look at there shh big old

tree big ol tree i put a big tree up

painting one time the lady screamed at

me

absolutely screamed at me so if you

don't want a big tree in your painting

don't put one in there and then scream

at me this is your world so you do

whatever you want your painting okay

then i'll take the liner brush little

bit of liquid black and we'll just put

the indication of a few limbs here in

there now sometimes i add a little paint

thinner to the liquid black to make it

really flow easy just let it go just let

it really work right off your brush come

right on around there look at there see

and have some of these limbs that go up

and across the tree you don't have them

all just going out to side seeing you

can put all kinds of little tiny things

in there just by stroking the canvas you

see then mmm just get sort of crazy and

let them go

there man will take the knife and a

little bit of white brown let's put a

little touch of highlight on this tree

there

it's barely touch give it a little pull

it's like the paint grab this is a thick

thick paint so it'll grab hang on there

maybe this one comes right down in front

i can't see there you can just make all

the trees you want in your world okay

yeah

take the old fan brush and put a little

slow down here on his foots dad take

care of his old foots bigfoot's take the

liner brush put a little liquid white

and just lay on a little highlight here

and there create the illusion of a

little snow and i think with that we

bound have a finished painting so let's

take a little bit of a bright red liner

brush and we'll sign this one the old

clock on the wall tells me i got to

leave you for today but i'll be back

next time hope you have your easel set

up class of t you all ready until then

happy painting

god bless

you

- hi, welcome back.

we're certainly glad you could

join us today.

i thought today maybe we could

just do a fantastic little painting

that i hope you'll enjoy.

let's start out and have them run

all the colors across the screen

that you'll need to paint along with us.

while they're doing that,

let me show you what i got done today.

i have my standard, old, pre-stretched,

double-primed canvas,

and i've covered it with just a

very thin coat of liquid white.

so it's all wet and slick,

and it's ready to go.

let's just have some fun today.

today, let's start with
a little tiny brush,

the two-inch brush.

we'll take a small amount
of alizarin crimson.

we don't need much, just a little

alizarin crimson. just tap a little

in the bristles.

there we go,

and let's go right up in here.

we'll put a little bit
up in the sky today,

somewhere delicate, just want to

warm it up. be very careful.

in a heartbeat, you can
set the sky on fire.

all we want to do is warm it a little.

there we go, something about like so.

that's all we need.

maybe a touch more of that,

and we'll have a little water,

down here at the bottom.

i'll put a little bit
down here at the bottom.

maybe a little of that pinkish color

will reflect right into the water.

if we don't have water,
we'll just cover it up.

no big deal because in our world,

we can do anything that we want to do.

alright, in that case, let's go

into a little bit of the phthalo blue.

once again, don't need much,

and it don't even have to clean the brush.

the phthalo blue is so much stronger

than the crimson, it'll just eat it up.

let's go back up in here.

i'm just gonna make little x's,

little criss-cross strokes,

something like that.

go all the way across the top.

bring it down til it
almost touches the crimson.

once again, the blue is so much stronger

if you're not careful it'll
just eat all the crimson up.

there, about like so.

while i still have that brush going,

i'm gonna take a little prussian blue,

which is much darker, and just add

to the corners on each side.

something like that,

and, once again, while i have the blue

on the brush, i'm gonna go down

and put a little bit down here.

if i'm gonna have water, we need

a little blue down there,

something about like that.

there we go.

it really doesn't matter
because we'll change it

in any direction that we want

when we get there.

there, alright, and now, the most fun part

of the whole procedure.

let's clean the brush.

we wash our brushes, as you know,

with odorless paint thinner,

and i really, really recommend that

it's odorless or you'll become

the most unpopular person

in the whole house.

if you do that in the living room,

you're going to become unpopular too.

get your little brush beater rack

that you put down in the garbage can

to contain all that.

there we go.

i do it here in the studio
because they pick on me.

it's a way of getting even with them.

there we are,

and besides that, it's a lot of fun.

okay, very gently, just
blend the entire sky,

and take out the little brush strokes.

same thing here in the water.

we're just gonna blend it a little bit.

see that little bit of
pink is still there.

it shows right through,

and that's exactly what we wanted to do.

alright, let's have some fun.

let's take- i've got several of these

two-inch brushes going- i want to

take one and tap it, tap right

into the titanium white.

show you a simple, simple little way

of making a happy little cloud.

all we're gonna do is just take

and tap in a little, basic shape.

we don't care, just tap it, there.

this is the easiest way i've ever found

of making very effective clouds.

just tap, but you do have to put in

basic shape. you can't just tap it random,

and a cloud appears, there.

think about basic shape.

now, this old cloud could float

around and just have a good time all day.

maybe, maybe something about like here.

it doesn't matter.

a clean, dry brush and very gently,

very, very gently, one herrance of air,

we can just blend this rascal

until it's as soft as you want it to be.

it's that easy, that easy, alright.

we've got some happy little clouds

that just live up here in our sky.

okay, great, there.

if you just have a little
paint on your brush,

you can just beat it like that.

it'll take the paint off,

and it's easier than going through

the whole cleaning procedure.

let's make us a little mountain.

for that, i'm gonna
take some prussian blue,

some black, a little brown in there too,

a little van dyke, some crimson,

maybe a little more of the crimson.

just mix them up.

cut off a little roll of paint,

should lay right on
the edge of your knife.

let's decide, in our world, maybe way,

up in here, there's just a happy little

mountain lives way up here.

we don't care, however you want it to be.

that's the way it should be.

there we are, something like so.

i'm scraping off all the excess paint,

all of it. what's left is exactly right.

it's absolutely perfect, there.

i'll take the two-inch brush, grab it,

and just pull.

that does two things.

most important, it removes excess paint

so the next layer goes on much easier.

secondly, it blends the paint down,

so it looks misty down at the base.

that's exactly what
we're looking for today.

we can wash the old brush,

just want to wash the brush, there.

i'll say, that's really the most fun part

of this whole procedure.

let's take some titanium oil

and put the least little
touch of bright red in it

and maybe even a little
bit of the midnight black.

i want to gray it and warm it.

don't over-mix it.

leave that marbled,

all those little designs
will stay right in there.

okay, let's go up in here.

little roll of paint, and we touch.

we just follow the angle of the mountain.

follow it, follow it, see?

follow right along, just like that.

that's all there is to it.

no pressure though,
absolutely no pressure.

let the knife float.

i've said it over and
over in other series,

but when i was teaching my son, steve,

to paint, i used to tell him,

"if you just pretend that he was a

whisper, and he floated
across the mountain,"

and it's sort of a good analogy.

he understood, and today, today,

that little rascal makes the best

mountains in the industry.

alright, now that i've
taken a little white,

a little touch of the prussian blue,

made a little shadow color,

and, with that, we'll
come right up in here,

and we'll put the indication of some

happy little shadows that
live in our mountain.

right along in here, once again.

absolutely no pressure, no pressure.

just let it sort of float.

when you have this much power,

you've got to make decisions.

maybe right here, yep, you're right.

see, here's another little peak,

and maybe it comes right
around here somewhere.

i don't know, don't know
that we really care.

i just want to show you how to do it,

and you decide where they live.

back to our shadow color.

each little highlight needs its own

individual shadow. it won't play with you.

it'll just go home.

give each one a shadow.

maybe it sort of bends over like that.

it's your world, and, in your world,

you can do anything that you want.

clean, dry two-inch brush. we'll create

a little bit of a mist up here,

just by tapping.

pay very close attention to the angles,

and follow them. lift upward.

takes out the little tab marks, sort of.

sort of blends it all together, that easy.

there we are.

once again, just blend it.

angles are most important
though, most important.

sometimes, let's get crazy, sometimes,

i like to paint like a
big ridge of mountains

that lives underneath one mountain.

it's striking, so we'll
have a little ridge

that comes right down through here.

we don't know where it goes.

maybe it goes on over here somewhere.

oh, i'll probably put some trees there,

so don't worry about it.

you know me, i alway
have to have a big tree.

so i'll probably have a tree there.

put a little paint on.

grab two-inch brush and pull it,

the same as we did before. pull it.

really get in there and grab it.

that pulls that paint down

and removes excess paint.

there, something about like that.

we don't care where it goes.

there we are.

now, we'll take, once
again, i'm putting a little

black with the white to gray it.

just a little.

a small roll of paint and no pressure.

no pressure. i'm using
less paint on this one.

a lot less paint just
barely, barely touching it.

i just want the indication here.

think where light would hit.

this mountain says our light's coming

from the right, so pay attention

to where light would strike.

think about it in your mind.

just think about it. just let it go.

no pressure at all, none whatsoever.

i know you get tired of hearing that,

but it's so important,
and i get letters everyday

from people who say, "i'm
still having a little

problem with the mountains."

it's one of two problems.

the paint is too thin.
the paint is too thin,

and it, as steve, my son, said,

just mushes together, and you have mud.

or you're applying too much pressure.

one or the other. one or the other. there.

once you get the pressure thing down,

then it's easy. then it's so easy.

i get letters everyday, as i say,

from people all over the world,

fantastic friends, and they tell me

they never believed they could paint,

and they're doing paintings now

that friends and relatives absolutely

don't believe. i bet some of them tell me

that the friends start looking real close

and start trying to find the numbers.

they think they're paint-by-number.

they never believe that their friend

had that kind of talent,
but you can do this,

you really and truly can do this.

there we go.

i have youngsters in their 90's tell me

that they wanted to
paint their entire life.

now, they're doing it.
now, they're doing it.

if you can do this, you can do anything

that you believe you can
do, anything, anything.

i know you can do it, and if i know,

you certainly do, there. alright.

that's all i want there,
just the indication

of some nice cliffs or something there

underneath that big mountain.

there we go. i'm just gonna lift this up

and blend this together,
something like so.

i want this to be very soft at the base,

very, very soft. alright.

shoot, you're doing okay there.

pretty nice looking mountains we made

in just a few minutes.

how long will it take?

i'm going to take some
of that mountain color,

add a little white to it.
i want to lighten it up

a little bit, about like that.

maybe, i'll clean the knife here.

i'll get a fan brush.

maybe, in our world, way back,

under this mountain, maybe there's

an indication of a few old trees

that are far away. we can't make out

a lot of detail in these trees.

these trees are too far away to have

a lot of detail. so
don't spend a lot of time

trying to put every leaf on these.

it will ruin the illusion
of distance if you do.

when things are far away, you see shape,

basic color, and that's all. there.

now we take a two-inch brush. tap it.

tap it severely right on
the bottom and lift up.

i tapped it down here only to create

the illusion of mist,
a little bit of mist.

you know me, i'm crazy about trees.

so i thought, now, maybe today

we'd do a few trees. why not?

let's take prussian blue, phthalo green.

i like phthalo green in
my evergreens sometimes.

a little van dyke, some crimson,

and we'll just mix all those together,

all of them together.

i might as well mix up a pretty good

pile of paint. wipe off the knife.

i just wipe the knife
on an old paper towel.

there we go. let me find an old fan brush.

hey, there's one.

i've got too many brushes going here.

i'm gonna load it full of paint,

both sides, a lot of color.

okay, let's go up in here.

big decision time.

we have a tree; we do have a tree.

it lives right there now.

just use the corner of
the brush to start out.

as you work down the tree,
push harder and harder.

really smush it in, once again,

as steve says. he's quite a character.

i think he's almost 27 years old now,

and he's painted his entire life.

that's all he's ever known,

and i'm so proud of him.

he is a character, a little short guy;

he's nearly 6'6" now, calls me shorty.

there, a little touch here.

steve is so accomplished
at what he's doing,

him and my dear friend, damon jester,

they travel around and
they teach instructers

how to instruct.

plus, we have a couple of
other people that do it.

there, but at his young
age, he's practiced

enough already that him and damon

teach people how to instruct.

so we have teachers running loose

all over the country.

there, gotta spread the joy.

okay, we'll have another one right there.

add another one right there.

there we go. wherever.
this is your forest.

you can make it any way you want it.

sometimes, you can just
do something like this,

and, because we don't worry
about detail at the base,

only where they stand as individuals,

down here you can care less.

we'll separate that with highlights.

you don't even have to worry down here.

all you're worried
about is some nice tops.

see? we just made a forest
right there. that easy

we'll come back with a little light green,

and we'll just highlight
those little rascals. easy.

okay, i like bigger trees.

we are gonna have a forest here.

and, when you're painting, i'm not having

too much trouble here,
but, when you're painting,

if when you go over a mountain like this

or something, you have a hard time

making it stick, dip the brush

into a little bit of paint thinner.

then go through your color.

it'll thin the paint just enough

that you can go right over the top

of that other without it
mixing together so bad.

alright, we said we was
gonna have a big tree here,

so i think we should do that.

here we are, a big old tree,

and, once again, down here, we don't care.

we really don't care because i'm going to

fill this up full of trees.

i want a whole forest out here

in front of this beautiful mountain.

there, and maybe i'll have one more

right here, just to cover up that hole

we got left. we're in business.

now, you can fill this up here

with a paint roller. it doesn't matter.

it doesn't matter.

just quickly drop in some stuff.

in fact, i could've painted these with

one or two-inch brush and been

a little faster. now
then, i'll tell you what,

let's see something here.

let's take, let's take, yeah.

let's just bring this together

down here on the bottom

like water.

there, just bring them together.

this is our world, so we can do anything

we want to here, anything we want to do.

there we go, and maybe, in our world,

maybe a little of this is reflected

right down into the water.

yep, you're right.

just pull a little bit straight down.

it's important that it
comes straight down.

i'm trying to save a little bit of pink.

and go across. isn't that easy? that easy.

have instant reflections.
yeah, i like that.

now then, this is the little fan brush

that had the tree color on it.

i just went into some cad yellow,

yellow ochre, and i'll
hit the indian yellow

any minute here.

because it had blue and black in it

when i touched this, it turned green.

so i take a little of
that and put it in there,

it turns beautiful green.

let's go up in here, and,
with that color, now,

we can come back in here

and begin picking out the highlights.

yeah, once again, if it
doesn't stick too well,

and mine's not, add a
little paint thinner.

see, now, watch the difference.

a little paint thinner
and i just pull the brush

back through the color.

that thinned it out, and now it just sets

right on top of that. there.

the brush goes away, i'm just loading

a little more color on it, that's all.

now, i like to keep my
evergreens very dark

toward the base because that way,

it looks to me like there's
big shadows down there.

i like to keep evergreens
pretty dark period.

to me, they're darker than trees

with leaves on them. it's an individaul

thing. the only rule
here is that you enjoy,

and it makes you happy.

if it does that, it's
perfect, it's perfect,

couldn't be any better,
no matter what you do.

there. in painting, you
will continually grow.

every painting is a learning experience.

you know, in your heart, that your next

painting is gonna be better.

i tell our instructors all the time

i hope they're plagued their entire life

with dissatisfaction. i
know that sounds horrible,

but as long as you're not satisfied

with what you do, then you
go back and you try it again.

you do it better and better and better.

i hope you have the same disease.

i hope every painting that you do,

you look at it, and you say,

"i could do better," because you can.

you learn from every painting.

every painting is a learning experience.

everything in life is
a learning experience.

it is not failure.

if it doesn't work the way you
want it, it is not failure.

it just means you learned something.

as long as you're learning,
you're not failing.

let's take a little on the two-inch brush,

a little of that same green, yellows,

maybe a little bright red here and there.

tap and let's go up in here.

maybe in our world, see, maybe this is a

beautiful little grassy area back here.

it's one of them places you'd like to

take your shoes off in, and let your feet

run naked through there. phew, nice.

nice, i like little meadows.

there, you need some dirt down here.

you take a little brown and dark sienna

mixed together, and
we'll put the indication

of some soil, dirt, whatever
you want to call it.

there. i like that. just a
little, little brown and white

mixed together to make a highlight.

there. just a little. i'm
going to bring some grass down,

so it doesn't matter,
a little over the shoe.

a little over the shoe.

okay, grab me a one-inch brush

and dip it into a little
bit of liquid white

just to dim this color,
get some sap green,

some yellow, more of the sap green there.

phew, nice color. pull
that brush in one direction

to load it, then turn it over,

so the round corner is at the top.

let's go up here. with
that round corner up,

now we can touch, push, bend very gently

and create the illusion of all kinds of

little bushes and trees
and happy little things.

they live here. they
live here in our world.

a little yellow ochre,
maybe a little touch

of the bright red, right on the end

to make a little flower
that lives out there.

sneaky, huh? another little bush.

he lives there. i know him. i know him.

he's my friend. he's my friend.

he's my friend. there. i know.

painters are a little weird. go out

and make friends with bushes and trees,

but that's okay. that's okay.

whatever it takes. now, back
to the old two-inch brush.

we'll come right along in here

and put in some more of that

soft grassy area. there.

just a little here and there.

wherever you think that it should be.

bring them together. the more you tap,

the softer they'll become
until it looks like

velvet laying out here, or silk.

you can do that. you really can do that.

a little bit of liquid white
and we can come right in here,

add a little water line indication.

this is just a light
area between the darks,

that's all. just a little
light between the dark.

alright. wherever. something like that.

now, sometimes it's fun, we get crazy.

i want to take the old one-inch brush

and maybe, over here, on this side,

there's a little bush
that lives right here.

we'll just drop in some dark

so we'll have something
for our light to show on.

there we go. get our
brush that has our green,

sap green, and the yellow on it.

let's just pop in a happy
little bush right here.

this bush sits on this side of the water

and watches everything happen.

there we are. okay, a little touch more

right in there, shoot.

well, i better get that
rascal where we want it.

i'll tell you what, i think
that one's about done.

i'm gonna take a little bit of red,

and we'll sign that one, call it finished.

hope you've enjoyed this little painting.

it'll give you experience
with all the equipment,

and if you can do this
one, you can do anything.

from all of us here, i'd like
to wish you happy painting.

god bless, my friend.

[jazz music]

- well, welcome back.

thought today we'd do a little picture

that maybe has got a
little calm ocean, and...

and we'll play with clouds today,

we'll play with light reflecting
all though the clouds,

and see what kind thing
we can come up with here.

and we're gonna start out,

i'm gonna take a little bit of yellow,

and just a little bit of permanent red,

and we're gonna work with the sun today.

we're gonna put the sun in here.

now i've already covered the canvas

with a thin layer of magic
white, save a little time.

next we'll go into a little bit of white,

and a touch of alizarin crimson.

and we'll work that a little bit.

and maybe very gently.

and always making these little x patterns.

there we go, just work it
right on back into here.

and then i'm gonna go
into a little alizarin,

a little touch of prussian blue.

it makes sort of a, oh like
a little lavender color here.

and we'll just work that
from out here inward.

we'll play with some crazy
colors in the sky today.

just come right on
around with it like that.

there we go.

i know somebody's out
there sayin' already,

"sure don't look like the sun to me."

now let's take the big brush,

and we're gonna start
bringing all this together,

very gently.

there we go.

see how all those colors
just blend together?

now we'll hypnotize it, just a little bit.

and while i've got this brush dirty,

i'll take just a little touch of the blue.

and lavender mixed together here.

and we'll do this.

and bring it right in here.

we don't wanna destroy this
nice, reflected light area

that we're putting into the water already.

just very gently bring all this together.

there we go.

clean up the brush.

now, let's take a little titanium white.

load the brush full,

and we'll go right into
the center of this.

we'll grind that into the canvas,

just really push that color in.

there.

and we'll take the knife,

and take off the excess paint.

the value remains in the canvas.

and now we can work
with that a little bit.

and the first color we put on,

turns out to be the aura
that's around the sun.

okay, now.

we can play with some
almighty clouds here,

and we'll take a little
brown, and a little blue.

make up a nice little color here.

sort of a grey color.

and let's build some almighty clouds.

and we just let these
run right across the sun.

be careful not to put
too much blue into this,

you want it to grey,

otherwise when you hit that yellow,

it's gonna turn green on you.

there we go.

nice fluffy little cloud.

just layin' around here
in the sky, bein' lazy.

okay maybe we'll have
another little cloud up here.

just let him play.

there he goes.

now let's put some
highlights on these clouds.

and right close to the sun here

i want them to be quite bright.

there.

little bit more into the
orangey type, pinkish hue.

there we go, that's better.

and a little brighter
on this edge right here.

and there we are.

just lay these on.

let all these pretty little colors

just sort of float through the clouds.

and mix the color in your brush.

that way you have a multitude
of colors all in one brush.

now on this cloud, the
light, as you can see,

is coming from the other direction.

so it's gonna hit the bottom
of the cloud more than the top.

and we'll put some little
sparkles here and there.

there we go.

maybe some little highlights
just playing around.

now we'll take the big
brush, and very gently,

super, super light, just
enough to bring this together.

just wanna blend them together.

little little bit.

build some of the
highlights here and there.

now we can hypnotize the whole thing.

if you haven't used a firm
paint, now you're in trouble.

so be sure your paint is very, very firm.

now let's put some little small clouds,

just lay it along here.

just little stringy clouds, i call 'em.

for lack of a better name.

and we'll take a little bit of color,

and highlight these clouds.

just across the top.

just like the sunlight's
bouncing along here,

and playing and having fun.

there.

now we'll gently hypnotize these,

and just bring 'em right into the picture.

there we go.

now we'll take just a
little touch of magic white.

we need a thin paint,
thin, thin paint here.

be sure you're finished with
your sky when you do this,

'cause it's just about
over once you start this.

we'll put some little light
rays comin' through here.

just indications.

like you're bouncing through and playin'.

just enough to give it a
little indication back here.

now let's see, way back
here, very lightly.

let's just make us a little
water line back in here.

like so.

thought we'd do like a nice
bay, or something like that.

the water's not violently rough.

just nice, few little
ripples here and there.

few little waves coming in.

just work those around.

now as we get up closer here,

let's have a little wave
in here, just like so.

put this little darker
color in so it'll stand out.

maybe just a little one back in here.

little dark underneath these.

now we take a little bit of white,

little magic white with
it, and we're gonna push.

little bit of foam on top of that water.

sort of pull that down.

and maybe here it's already curled over.

and we just lift that
right over like that.

a little bit in here.

now if you're doing this
at home, when it dries,

take little dots of white
paint, and just lay all in here,

and it'll look like the
light's just sparkling,

right across the water,

with just little dots of white paint.

don't over do it.

just little foamy things happening

all throughout here.

very light, we don't want
anything real bright back here.

now then, i think i'll take
a little alizarin crimson,

and sap green mixed together
to make a nice brown color.

warm, warm brown, since we've
used the alizarin in here.

and brown is such a nice color,

it's a very warm, peaceful color.

maybe we'll put some little
things like this in here.

there we go.

put some little grassy things,
layin' here on the beach.

there.

and let's take a little
bit of the prussian blue.

maybe there's a little
place layin' right in here,

where the water sort of formed.

so we'll put just a little
more blue right here.

like so.

there we go.

now i'm gonna make a
mixture of brown and white.

and we'll make some
sand here on the beach.

and we just let this knife
work right down through here.

very gently.

try to get the paint to break like that.

maybe we'll go back right over here.

maybe we'll have this coming
right down through here.

and we can start putting
all these little bushes

and weeds that grow out here on the sand.

this is still the sap
green and alizarin crimson.

there we go.

and follow the lay of the land here.

you want it to look like
it's sorta coming down.

if we're gonna have a
little pool of water here,

you need to have it coming down.

so it just works in there.

there we go.

and we can take and lay
a little bit of sand

right down through here.

let's start with some
reflections in this water.

little touch right here.

let's build some nice little reflections

in this little pool that's laying here.

now we come ahead and
decide where we want the

dirt to come.

maybe it'll come right out like that.

let's put a little thing right out here.

there we go.

very lightly.

and we can bring some over in here.

maybe this one comes way off.

it would if i didn't run out of paint.

there we go.

lay that in there.

now we take a little bit of magic white.

and we'll put some little things happening

around the water's edge here.

just here and there.

always have a lot of foam
that builds up around the sea.

so we'll just have all those
little foamy things in here.

little bit over here.

so it looks like that
just sort of slips on

into the background there.

and off and away.

now we can put a few more
little things in here,

just to build this up.

still following the lay of the land.

arighty.

let's take some brown here.

i'm gonna put like an old snow fence,

coming down through here i think.

so we'll start with
straight van dyke brown.

and these old fences are...

made out of just whatever
happens to be available.

so they're all different
sizes, all different shapes.

the wind and the weather,

they tear them apart and
they really get bad looking.

so we'll just lay them in here.

some of 'em are just about to rot.

maybe there's a little
short one right here.

give him a little more, there.

this one over here, maybe
he just comes like so.

every which way, ever which way.

and we'll just let these happen.

sometimes they're close together,

sometimes they're far
apart, so wherever you want.

there.

and maybe one's just about to fall over,

there he goes.

now i'll take a little touch
of the light color here,

and i'm gonna just put
a little touch of light.

right on the edge of
these, just here and there.

this is just brown and white.

just a little bit.

those do look nice and old.

they've been hangin' around
the beach for a long time.

there we go.

now take a little bit of paint here.

and let's just make this old
thing just wander around.

it's just about had it.

come right on down, there.

maybe this one has a
bunch on the other side,

so we just keep on cutting through.

come through like this.

and let's give him one more.

that went so well let's
do another one, there.

now if your really wanna
spruce these up a little bit,

you can put just a little bit on top here.

let's use just a little
touch lighter color,

so it shows up, there.

just a little light
playin' along the corner.

and use the small edge of this knife, too,

don't just use the...

other edge.

now then, let's...

let's put a nice little tree right here.

we need an old, tired tree.

that's live right next to
the ocean all of it's life.

it's not the best place in the world

for an old tree to live.

there, boy he looks tired already.

let's give him another little helper here.

there we go.

okay, let's use the
little liner brush here.

and just put some
highlights right along here.

let those sort of fade back.

give him a few more little branches.

this is just a thin oil.

that's mixed with a paint so
it's a little bit thinner.

and then it flows better.

he comes right along.

like that.

and we just put a few
little limbs at random,

and then we'll put some leaves on him.

maybe right in here,

maybe there's the one that's just tired,

he's hangin' down.

there.

poor old tree.

okay.

we'll take a little bit of...

little alizarin and the sap green again.

maybe dull it down with
a little bit of brown,

we don't want this very bright.

alright, that's nice.

just put some little leaves on here.

there we go.

just drop the little rascals
on wherever you want 'em.

maybe we'll just put these back,

and let this limb protrude on through.

maybe he's already got
tired one on strike.

just layin' out there by himself.

we'll take a little bit of...

green, a little yellow.

and i put just a little touch
of brown with it to dull it.

once again, i don't want this
to be a bright, bright tree.

i want this to be quite dull.

put a few little highlights here.

there we go.

just here and there.

alright.

we can go back and fill in some more

of these little busy areas.

just to give him a little...

character.

there, that's nice.

take a little alizarin
crimson and brown here,

and maybe we'll just
put a few little things

that are trying to grow here.

life's sort of rough out here,

so he's not doin' too great.

just here and there.

maybe there's one layin' over here.

this is a very quiet little seascape.

something you can do.

it's just a little practice,
and i think you'll enjoy it.

it's probably the most
fun working with a sky.

there's a multitude of
things you can do here.

there's no limit to the
different colors you can use,

you can change 'em to any
color that pleases you.

feel free.

we're not trying to
teach you to copy here,

we're trying to teach you a technique.

and how you use that technique
is strictly up to you.

you're only limited by your imagination.

so let it go, have fun with it, practice.

and you too can be an almighty painter.

i think we'll very
quickly sign this picture.

and we'll call it finished, so
we'll take a little bit of...

thin paint here.

just do that.

i wanna thank you very very
much for watching us today,

i hope you have enjoyed this picture,

it's a little different than
what we've done in the past.

but it gives you some more
ideas of what you can do.

until next time, happy painting.



- hello again. glad to see you.

thought today we'd one of
these almighty black canvases.

it's time we got into doing
something on a black canvas.

i'd like to show you how

you can do a beautiful,
beautiful landscape

on a black canvas.

i've already went ahead,

because we are short of time on this show,

i've already went ahead and
covered the whole canvas

with alizarin crimson.

now i'm gonna take a little van dyke brown

and work into the edges,
just around the edges,

so it's, we already have it
covered with alizarin crimson,

and now we're putting
a little brown on it.

the whole canvas was covered with crimson.

there we go.

just around the corners.

thought today we'd do a
beautiful little sunset.

and maybe we'll have a little sunset

like the sun's going down
behind the hill back there.

and we just have a
beautiful glow in the sky,

and then we'll go from there.

now i'm gonna take and
pull this back and forth

to a get a nice even
distribution of paint,

working it up and down, back and forth.

there we go.

all right.

mm 'kay, now we'll start
with a one-inch brush,

we'll use a little bit of cad yellow.

figure out where the
sun is, just went down,

and we're gonna start like right here.

and begin working this paint around.

you start in the center and work

around and around and around,

and already it's picking
up the alizarin crimson

and it's turning into

a beautiful little yellow-ish
orange-ish glow here.

there we go.

and we'll start right
here, let it work outward.

you want it to get darker and
darker and darker and darker

as it goes out toward the edges.

so we always start with a
color in here and work outward.

there we go.

okay.

a little bit of color here, work it out,

and i'm doing this in
little-bitty x patterns.

back and forth, back
and forth, there we go.

mm 'kay.

now let's take the big brush,

and gently gently hypnotize this.

we're still making the little x's.

there.

just work that in.

and then just enough to
take out the brushstrokes.

okay.





okay, let's take a little bit
of alizarin, a little brown,

put it together here on the
brush, mix on the brush.

and maybe back here in the distance

we'll have a little foothill back here.

just let this brush bounce along and play.

there we go.

don't let the size of
this big brush scare you.

it does fantastic things.

okay.

now, maybe we'll have some highlights.

take the little yellow and green and,

little touch of red here,

and we just push some little
highlights coming down here.

we'll make these little foothills
way back in the distance.

okay.

let's put some back over here.

there we go.

then we'll take a clean brush,
and just gently lift up,

very very lightly,

just enough to give it an upward swirl.

there.

very light, barely barely
touching the canvas.

you let two or three
hairs just about touch.

just enough to move
the paint a little bit.

okay.

now we'll take a little yellow

and a little permanent
red mixed together here,

and we'll start putting
in some reflections.

maybe we'll have a little,

have a little lake right
back here, a little pond.

just lay a little color on.

and pull this down.

there we go.

then just enough to give
a little watery effect.

just

ripple it a little.

we don't want to destroy.



mm 'kay.



clean the old brushes here,
and we'll move right along.

okay now i'm gonna go back
into this brown and alizarin.

once again we're mixing it on the brush.

a lot of paint on the brush.

maybe we'll put a little
tree standing back here.

we'll make this one with the fan brush.

there we go.

and trees get lonely too,
so we'll give him a friend.

there.

and maybe there's a
little one right there.

got two big ones, so,
invariably sooner or later

there's gonna be a little one.

there he is.

let's fill him in, make
him just a touch darker.

maybe we'll put a third one right there.

work that in a little bit,
create a shadow behind the tree.

okay.



now, we'll just, with a knife here

we'll just make a little waterline

running back through here.

these black canvases, we
cover with a black acrylic.

a flat black acrylic paint,

and allow it to dry before we start.

and the alizarin crimson that we use here,

is a transparent color, so
the black shows through.

it looks black, but when
you apply color to it,

man it really comes alive.

okay, let's start with some
almighty trees and stuff.

we'll use the big brush today.

and let's have a big old tree right here.

i know this may be quite
difficult for you to see

but we are putting the general
shape of the tree right here.

these black canvases make
some of the prettiest pictures

that you could imagine.

and if you're interested
in selling paintings

and making a happy buck
to put in your pocket,

these are the ones that really sell.

let's have another tree right over here.

let these limbs just fly out, firemen.

maybe a big tree up here.

and as you can see, we're
really hitting this canvas,

we're really pushing the paint into it.

you need an almighty easel.

little tiny tim easels will let you down.

this easel is made out of
a platform step-ladder.

and they work very very well.

they're very strong, very simple to build.

okay.

we've got that filled in.

let's put some tree trunks here and there.

okay.

and we'll put some dark
paint right along here.

there we go.

just, in your mind,

wherever you visualize there
might be a little trunk,

just drop one in.

now mix just a little brown and white,

so we can put a little
touch of highlight on this

and make it stand out a little,

like a light's playing
through here and touching it.

there.

and we'll put a trunk right
over in this one, too.

little dabble.

okay.

now, if the sun's here, light's
coming from this direction,

this would be highlighted
on the other side.

now probably in reality,
if the sky was this dark,

you would have nothing but silhouettes.

but that would be a boring picture.

this is a lot more fun.

okay, you take a little
bit of magic white,

little yellow,

maybe a touch of phthalo green.

and we can put some nice little leaves

on all these little bushes.

look how that color stands out

against this black background.

it just jumps out at you.

okay, now, let's,

let's put some on this little bush.

and there's some little
things growing down in here.

use your imagination, let it go.

let it go.

remember, this is your world.

in your world you can create
anything that you desire.

okay, let's do this old big tree here.

what's so very nice about
these black canvases,

if there's a light
shining directly on them

they look totally different
than if they're without a light.

so in essence it's almost like

having two paintings in one.

especially if you hang these,
after they're finished,

over a light, so at night
if you turn the light on

it shines up on this,

it's remarkable what happens.

there we go.

all the little bushy areas.

maybe some little touches out here.

okay.

now let's take some more van dyke brown

and let's put an almighty tree right here.

we'll just let him bend and play and

work right on up to here.

and, there we go.

there.

have another little limb
coming down through here.

and maybe there's some little things

happening up here in the leaves.

and we'll have a little
light playing across here.

just pull that knife sort of, swirled,

so it gives the appearance
of it being round.

there we go.

now we're ready to put some highlights

on these little leaves out here.

okay.

and just let the light
play through this tree.

leaving a lot of dark areas.

we need these dark areas to
make the tree look round.

don't kill 'em all.

such a, such a temptation,
to do a little bit more.

i used to work with one art teacher,

that, he had a set of handcuffs
that hung in the studio,

and he'd walk by and he'd bump you

and he'd point at those handcuffs.

and that was his way of saying,

"you're beginning to fiddle it to death."

we don't have any handcuffs here today,

but stand back and look
every once in a while.

don't overwork your picture,
you'll fiddle it to death.

okay.

this looks like a

super place, maybe, to have a little path

that runs up through there.

so now take a little prussian
blue and van dyke brown

and just very easy here,
we'll just make a little path

that runs right through this.

got to have a way to get around the lake

to catch that big trout
that lives out there.

know he's there.

okay.

then we'll put just a little
bit of highlight on there.

just let that run down
through there and break.

you want that paint to break.

so it leaves some of those
beautiful dark areas in there.

there we go.

now.

little bit more magic white here.

just want to thin that paint

so it'll stick on top
of all the other paint.

now we can start in here.

we'll start putting some

nice little bushes that
are hanging over the path.

so the path just disappears
back here behind the big tree.

okay.

and these bushes
protruding up over the top,

push it down into the picture.

you need 'em.

they pay you great dividends.

and we'll put some on this side

of the road over there.

mm 'kay.

let's make another big tree.

maybe right up through here.

we'll just have a big ol' tree.

there he goes. van dyke brown.

van dyke brown's a very nice color,

it's almost like a
chocolate brown, very warm.

there.

okay, now a little limb right there.

now one thing i'd like
to mention while we're

putting the highlights on here,

if you have questions or comments or

anything you'd lie to know
about what we're doing here,

please feel free to drop us a line,

care wmvt, and we'll give you the address

at the end of the show.

and do use it, so you know,

we're here to help you,

if you have problems or
if you have questions,

anything concerning
this method of painting,

we'll be glad to work with
you and try to help you.

okay.

we'll put some highlights
up here on this one.

little bit more of the
magic, thin it down.

just a touch.

okay.

thousands and thousands and
thousands of little leaves.

okay, now, let's go down here,

put some little things around the tree.

and maybe you can, right here, say,

let's put a little stone.

maybe a little stone just
lays right along here.

of course he's a happy little stone.

we don't have any other kind.

and we'll make up a
little highlight color.

just lay right over there.

like so.

okay,

now let's put some, mm, nice one there.

nice one there.

okay, let's have some little
bushes right along in here.

now when you're doing this,

load this brush by pulling
it in one direction

so that it looks like
an old shoe on the end,

sort of hangs over.

you put that round part to the top,

and tilt the brush sort of downward

and just push,

just enough to bend the
bristles a little bit.

don't fight it, let the brush do the work.

you have the fun, let the brush work.

maybe we'll put a nice
little sparkler right there.

just sort of to break that up a little it.

okay.

now let's lay in a few
stems here and there.

and all we're doing here
is literally just cutting

right through the paint,
using the point of the knife.

we literally just cut the paint.

there we go.

this is one of the paintings

that we do in class quite frequently.

it's a very effective painting,

it teaches you how to use black canvases.

it's a lot of fun.

and it's extremely, extremely effective.

we'll have a few little
sticks coming over like so.

there we go.

and once again, these little
twigs and these little sticks

show different planes in the picture.

it produces the illusion of distance.

use 'em to your advantage.

'cause the woods are always full of them.

let's see, maybe back here we could just

put a little indication
of a trunk here and there,

some little sticks.

there we go.

okay.

all righty, i think this
one's just about ready.

then we can sign it.

so i'll use a very thin oil here.

and we'll just take

and use the liner brush,

and you mix this paint
until it's like water.

and if you mix it very very thin,

curl that brush as you pull it out,

twist it, so it brings it to a point.

it's just like you were writing.

you don't have to wait
until the painting is dry.

okay.

there.



this same technique is also very good

if you want to put some nice
little sticks and limbs in

that you wanted to draw in,

use the oil to get the paint thin.

and then maybe we could
come right across and,

'cause a thin paint will
stick to a thick paint.

there.

just let these little things
happen here and there.

okay.

one of the things that we're trying to do

as we travel around and
teach this almighty method,

is we're trying to gather
up an army of teachers.

and soon we'll have teachers that

travel this entire beautiful country,

teaching this fantastic
method of painting.

if you would like to
have some information,

drop us a line.

once again,

we'll show you the address
at the end of the show.

and soon we'll have
information on teachers

that are all the way across this country.

teachers that we can guarantee

that can teach this fantastic method.

okay.

i think now, we'll just
put a couple little things

here and there.

put another little stick or two.

i hope you've painted along with us

and you've enjoyed this
half as much as we have.

we really enjoy doing
these black canvases,

they are extremely, extremely effective,

and you'll find

that they bring a nice
warm glow to your heart.

these can be done in
a multitude of colors.

you can cover 'em with any
color that's transparent.

we can use the prussian blue, sap green,

any of these colors, or
combinations of colors.

later on in this series

we'll do a winter
picture on a black canvas

and i'll show you how you
can put the moon in the sky

and let the light play across the snow

when you have the almighty
mountains and stuff.

and i'll think you'll find

these black canvases
can do fantastic things.

we also wanna do some
pictures in the series

where we paint the canvas with one color.

instead of putting the
magic white on the canvas,

we'll paint it, for
example, the sap green.

and we'll paint beautiful pictures

by doing that.

there's a multitude of things
that can be done with this.

use it, experiment with it, go with it.

just let your heart be your guide.

let your imagination take you
anywhere that you want to go.

let it go.

okay.

all righty, i think we're gonna
call that picture finished.

and, once again,

we want to thank you very
much for watching us.

and from all of us here
at wmvt, happy painting.

thank you very much.



hi welcome back i'm glad you could join

to paint along with me today i'll set

him down i'll be right back with you so

we'll just set him right over here there

we go

he still squawking grab the old pallet

as you can see today we have a canvas up

here that's i've taken black gesso and

i've sort of painted a basic shape in

here and on top of the black gesso now

we've allowed that to completely dry and

then we've taken and put transparent

color over here and that's the mixture

of we put some van dyke brown a little

bit of phthalo blue and phthalo green

and i just covered it in this spot right

in here i've just put liquid white and

everything is wet and it's ready to go

so let's go tell you what let's start

out today with an old two-inch brush i'm

gonna go and pick up the least little

touch of the cad yellow just least

little touch there we go okay now right

here at the horizon i want to put a nice

bright little area right there

that easy maybe a little touch over here

okay now then without cleaning the brush

i'm gonna go right back over and pick up

a small small amount of yellow ochre

just a little yellow ochre okay

now this right above that and lying it

to blend together we'll put that ochre

mm it's pretty already

okay once again without cleaning the

brush i'm going to go right into bright

red so we started with cad yellow went

into yellow ochre and now we're into

bright red and just tap a little into

the bristles just tap it and then gets a

nice even distribution of color all the

way through the bristles okay now then

with the red we can go right in here

we're just using sort of little

crisscross strokes just apply a little

bit because you had the yellow when you

brush this is going to turn a beautiful

orange color there if we just blend it

right on down into the yellow ochre just

let it sort of disappear

that's pretty already i like these

colors now then once again without

cleaning the brush this is one of those

paintings i like because you don't clean

the brush a lot i'm lazy i want to write

it to phthalo blue just a small amount

of blue and once again tap the bristles

okay let's go back up here up in here

we'll put the blue there we go little

darker

i just let it blend right down to the

rib okay now we can wash your brush wash

your brush that's a fun part of all this

shake it off

cover everything in the studio now with

a nice clean dry brush you can go back

in here and just blend all this together

so you can't tell where one color stops

and the next color starts just like so

okay and that gives us a beautiful

little sky and it's very very simple now

then i'm put a little black on the brush

and then i'm going into yellow i put the

black on the brush only to make this

turn green when i touch it a little tiny

bit of the midnight black i'm going to

go and tap some color into it let's go

right back up here maybe there's a

little hill we back here in the distance

so all we do is just tap just tap all

you're doing is touching the canvas with

a brush canvas will pull off what it

wants give you back what's left

just like the tax man he takes all what

he wants gives you what's left usually

there's not much left there all you're

doing is just tapping gently gently

tapping if you want to show maybe

another plane in here

you start with fresh color and leave a

little dark area between them and you

can create the illusion of another plane

they're that easy and you can make as

many or as few as you want in your world

hope you enjoy seeing the little

creatures i like i like to show you the

little birds and stuff we have some

birds that are grown and i i can't show

those goes head they're sort of hard to

control a little owl he's a character

it's one of the most beautiful little

birds

okay well we have little brush going

tell you what we just take maybe we'll

just tap the corner here into a little

bit of paint we'll get a little yellow

ocher little indian yellow just the

corner of it just that corner okay let's

go back up here maybe right along here

lives a happy little tree i'm just going

to take the corner that brush and just

begin creating the basic shape of little

tree there and just a little touch of

the bright red there make a rascal stand

out and sing say all you need is a big

old two inch brush little imagination

some practice you can paint fantastic

paintings beautiful little paintings

look at there this bush lives right

there just sort of make up a scene in

your mind drop it on the canvas so

what's so nice about this style of

painting you can you can put an idea on

canvas before it escapes when i was

traditional painter i'd get an idea in

my mind and shooted by the time i got

around to painting it and spending a

week or two working on it the vision in

my mind had totally changed here you can

do it while it's fresh there all right

see now we've created a whole nother

plane right here just by doing that just

by doing that maybe tell you what to

tell you what

it helps to be a little crazy when you

do this and think up little think about

little stories and make up little things

here in my mind i think this is a

beautiful place back here to maybe have

a little cabin that lives way back over

in there so for that let's take some van

dyke brown pull it out very flat we take

the old knife cut across so we have a

little roll of paint right on the edge

of the knife there you can see it good

now maybe our little cabin maybe it

lives maybe it lives right there we'll

paint the back eve first just like so

paint the other side of the roof mmm

there where see how easy that is if you

don't make those little noises oh it

won't work for you kind of make those

little noises doop there one right down

here and that is a nice way of blocking

in your basic shape for your little

cabin and you're not committed yet you

could still change that little rascal

any way that you want to maybe it's got

a roof on it that's a use of brown and

white little bit of black in there

what makes sort of a dirty gray color

just leave your color marble like that

we don't want to over mix it once again

our little roll of paint it's most

important how you load this knife now

then just touch and get nervous here let

it go oop oop oop oop oop oop oop oop

oop oop see there and it makes beautiful

little shapes on your house then you

just let it just bounce right along

through there looks like little shingles

you can see far off in there maybe a

little bit out here on the other side

you'd see a little touch there now they

don't get the small knife that small

knife is fantastic for sneaking into

little places we'll take some dark

sienna a little white mix them together

but not over mix them maybe we'll put a

touch of van dyke brown there too whoo i

like that that's nicely you get

beautiful colors happening right there

and when you pick up that little roll of

paint those same

colors are right they're not roll of

paint now then touch and just pull it

down barely barely grazing barely

grazing look at that see and that simple

you can paint the front of your little

house your little cabin now for the side

over here not as much light i'll hit

that so we'll add some more van dyck

brown will make it darker cut off a roll

of paint same way and and and look right

there we'll put a little bit on the side

and see there you can do that it's easy

we make painting easy we show you how to

do it

the only thing you have to add is

imagination there we are

make it look like are some little boards

in there mmm kitty now we need a door

let's put a door we take straight van

dyck brown you this little door right

there just come across with some brown

see you can make your doors big or as

small as you want it can take a little

touch of the white that'll just sort of

highlight the edges of it so you can see

it there right around like so shoot

maybe there's a little window in there

who knows would take a little blue

little touch of blue least little touch

it white it little we use a small edge

of the knife maybe

oop there that's enough to give the

indication that there's a little window

in there sometimes maybe we just will

make this edge stand out a little song

add a little light color right along

this edge so it'll stand out there you

can see it better now then we want to

fix the bottom of this cabin so we can

do a cabin ectomy there you go cabin

ectomy just cut it off and you have a

nice little cabin right there

they have them let's take a little brown

little crimson then we'll go into our

yellow only put those colors on there so

when they touch the yellow you get all

these different shades don't want just

straight yellow and a lot of things

happening little sap green too little

indian yellow yellow ocher a tap give

the brush a little push see how that

brushing a little ridge of paint right

out there that's what you're painting

with now then let's come back in here

and just begin barely touching and we

can add all these layers of little

grassy things that are happening there

over here on the other side the cabin

maybe this comes down like so okay tell

you why we need a way to get to this

little cabinet yeah let's take some van

dyck brown go right in here just begin

pushing that like so and we want to make

this path get larger large it's hard to

see right now against the black and

it'll show up there yeah we'll have it

coming right on around maybe down in

here somewhere

hmm okay as i said this brown it

probably won't show up a great deal

against the black background but when we

begin putting highlights in there it'll

come alive so let's begin working on

some little bushes and stuff at our back

here we just go back to the old two-inch

brushing just going to tap a little

color right into the corner of it here

again that's a nice easy way to make

some beautiful little tree in bush

shapes

maybe right back in here there lives a

nice little bush right there

see there he is you know he was there

you knew he was there look at that

and that sort of just pushes that cabin

right back into the distance there we go

now let's begin working on maybe some of

these trees here that are on the on the

sides so for that use the liner brush

and i'll go into will just use this

color right here that's a nice color

i was just brown and white we want that

paint to be very thin very thin let me

get a little more paint thinner here we

want to be sure it's a real thin like

ink turn the bristles in there all right

now maybe right up in here maybe there

lives a nice tree trunk right there turn

that brush let it wiggle and jiggle and

all kinds of things happen as it works

its way down there just keep turning it

it makes very interesting tree trunks

and you can come back in here and drop

in the indication of some little limbs

and branches and sticks and need a place

for a little owl to sit there why son of

a guns got some talons on him he'll get

you there you have to have to be very

careful with it be respectable because

he didn't realize how strong he is even

just a two week old baby out boy he's a

signer i got maybe over here see there

is another tree

maybe he's got a friend right here and

in your painting you put as many or as

few trunks as you want just sort of look

around and and each one will be

different look at your painting because

it's not going to be exactly the same as

mine the only thing we try to do here is

show you how to how to make effects how

to create certain illusions and then you

do with it whatever you want we each see

nature through different eyes so you

paint the way you see it and then it's

right and it's right the only rule that

i respect in art is if it makes you

happy then it's good you do what makes

you happy you paint scenes the way you

see them and that's when you really

really experience the joy of painting

there now we have all kinds of little

tree trunks and things happening in

there all i got that going maybe back in

these little bushes here you can make

out the indication of some little things

that are projecting up there's one and

once again you decide how many of these

live in your world and drop them in okay

tell you what let's do let's grab an old

one-inch brush here and we'll begin

putting some foliage in here going to go

up here grab a little touch of the black

and go into the green or the yellow the

little make green yellow ocher now tap

the bristles into the paint just tap

them that loads a small amount of paint

right out on the tip so you can see it

being pushed up right there right there

that's what you're after okay

now then begin thinking about shape and

form and all you have to do is just

barely touch the canvas and begin laying

in all kinds of beautiful little things

like maybe i'll make it a little bit

brighter so you can see it a little

better on tv there but now when you're

painting your picture at home you paint

it any way that you wanted if you have

trouble making your paint stick

at a small amount of the liquid white or

a little bit of paint thinner to your

brush there we go but once again the

most important thing here is worrying

about shape all the little individual

things that happen in here there we are

hmm this is one of the nicest easiest

ways of ever developed of making

beautiful beautiful little trees and

even if you've never painted before you

can do this you can do it it works we

give you everything you need here all

you need is just a little practice and a

little imagination and off you go

they're just layer after layer and don't

be in too big a hurry

just work in one section of your tree at

a time i have to be in a hurry here if i

don't get done in time lee i have no

sense of humor why they'll get me put it

home just take your time think about one

clump of leaves one group one individual

one friend there and just layer after

layer all these beautiful things live

deep in the woods and in the trees see

somes in the back somes in the

foreground anywhere you want there we go

once again if you have trouble making

the paint stick and the least little

touch of paint thinner or liquid white

on either one the liquid white of course

will make your pain a little brighter so

if you don't want it to get any brighter

then add nothing but paint thinner there

right in there okay

little baby when lives there too now

let's go on the other side here this big

old tree that's hanging out over here

we'll give him some nice highlights

there see still working in clumps or

groups that's what makes that son of

guns stand out and save some of these

dark areas in between that's what gives

you tree depth the tree starts looking

flat chances are you've killed all those

beautiful dark areas and you can go back

and put them in because we don't make

mistakes

we just have happy accidents learn to

work with anything it happens anything

it happens okay maybe since we have that

area we'll just put some leaves right

out here some nice highlights look at

that

cherry think you could take a big old

one-inch brush and make just thousands

of beautiful little individual looking

leaves that easy you really can really

can there we go

okay shoot i brush is too slow

let's get serious here get the old 2

inch brush it does the same thing only

faster will tap a little color into it

same ol way now that let's begin

creating the lay of the land just begin

deciding where this goes as it goes away

back into the shadow area back in here

use less and less pressure let it just

sort of disappear darker darker darker

back in here this is where creature

hides back in here ask with a little

bunny rabbit lives it's quiet and dark

there we go okay just varying the colors

a little bumps and hills in your land

all kinds of happy little things in here

but start at the area this father's to

way and work continually forward forward

forward and that helps create that a

illusion of depth the illusion of

distance in your painting and to me

that's extremely important in a painting

that it has depth and distance and many

many different planes in it there we go

see but this the curvature that you

putting put in here once again that

creates the lay of the land the way the

land flows the direction of the lamb

whatever you want to call it all means

the same thing and the more you tap this

the softer it'll become it just gets

thick it'll look like velvet if you work

it enough just like velvet i'm going to

add the least little touch of liquid

white just wanna then that paint a

little tiny bit more a little bit of

liquid white there we go see that sticks

easier any time you have problems making

the stick just try adding a little bit

of liquid white or paint thinner

there we're just layer after layer after

layer this is a very simple little

painting if you've never if you've never

painted before this is a nice one to

start with because it's very easy and it

works well okay add another little

little hill right there let's go over

the other side and have some fun over

there too she we don't want this side to

have it all we'll use a little more of

the sap green just tap that right in

there little little brush happen now

then i have to make a big decision maybe

maybe comes right down here you just

push that little cabin as far back as

you want you could come way up in here

if you wanted to and look like it's

behind the hill there we are maybe this

one comes from way over here somewhere

it just drops down

and maybe maybe maybe you want to create

maybe this is efficient a more severe

drop maybe it drops off faster than the

other side and you can do that just by

changing the angle make up little

stories in your mind once again and just

work from that there and you can turn

this so it comes toward you look like

all those little grassy and things and

little ferns that are hanging over just

layer after layer

i've probably painted 20,000 paintings

and i still get excited when i see this

work so fantastic every day i get

letters from people all over the country

who have never picked up a paintbrush in

their life and they tried this and it

works and they've experienced a whole

new world a whole new world and it makes

people happy and the people you share it

with it brings brings a lot of joy to

them it's the reason we call this a joy

of painting there i hit a little touch

of the bright red that time but see how

this is hanging over it's unbelievable

you can change these angles and create

all types of illusions kitting now and

let me find an old fan brush here we put

that van dyck brown in here and we

didn't show up much now watch what

happens i'll just take a little bit of

titanium white on the fan brush just a

little now we go back up here and we

just barely touch barely touch see now

that brown begins to show and we can

clean up the bottom of all these little

grassy areas bring it all back together

and you can make this as light and

bright as you want it just by adding

more white

you can add a little white with some

dark sienna in it that's very pretty

ever just sort of experiment a little

the fun in painting is the experimenting

learning new things every day if you

paint for a million years the next

painting is going to be your masterpiece

you'll always see something in your

painting that you can approve and i get

letters from people all the time and

they said i did a painting and i'm not

satisfied with it

that's fantastic because that makes you

want to go do another painting you see

what would make it better i hope you're

plagued with dissatisfaction your entire

life that way you'll get better and

better and better now maybe maybe here

and there you can even see the

indication little brown and there's too

bright that way or a little stone lives

right up here climbed right up the side

like heaven you can just put anything in

here that you want okay

shoot i think we'd better have a finish

paint either i won't take a little bit

of the bright red with paint thinner and

when you go to sandy's i get a lot of

questions about how do i sign it look

how thin this paint is i mean it's

literally it'll run you can see it

dripping right off the palate then like

ink turn the bristles in there and let's

go right up here and we'll sign this one

hope you've enjoyed is a fantastic

little painting it'll teach you a great

deal try it let me know how it works for

you that one's signed i think we're

going to call this painting finished and

on behalf of my little friend hoot that

i showed you the beginning of the show i

want to wish you happy painting

god bless i look forward to seeing you

again

you

- well hello, hope you
have your canvas set up

and ready to go, i think we'll
do another almighty picture.

and today, i wanna do
a ridge of mountains,

rather than the jagged, sharp mountains

that we've been doing,

i wanna do a nice, smooth
little ridge of mountains,

coming down into a beautiful little lake.

so we'll start off here

with a little bit of prussian
blue on the big brush,

there we go, just work
it into the bristles,

and we'll start right at
the top of the canvas.

ok, we'll put us a quick
little sky in here,

and we'll just move this paint
around, let it work, play.

don't want a dead sky.



ok.

now i've already had the
magic white on the canvas

before i started so,

we have that ready, there we go,

just nice little sky with some life in it.

now i put just a touch of
fatal green with my color,

and we'll put in some water.

there we go.

and sort of bring all that together.

we've left a little area open
right here in the center,

so that it'll look like a sheen of light

coming across the water.

ok.





there you go, just
redecorated your living room.

now, let's take a little
bit of the titanium white,

and just a little touch
of permanent red in it,

always like to put a little
bit of pink into my clouds,

just so it looks like a little sunshine.

and we'll do some
almighty big clouds here,

just let em work off that brush,

keep the brush moving.

keep it moving.

you don't wanna set and
grind one spot to death,

all you'll do is end up with
huge cotton balls in the sky.

and we want nice fluffy clouds.

leave some of these areas dark,

that'll end up being the
shadows in your cloud.

ok.

there we go.

maybe we'll just have a little cloud

floating around up in the sky up here.

there we are.

now maybe another nice little cloud,

with just a little touch
more pink with that one.

there, now he stands out,

we just want these to
be soft little clouds.

ok.

now we'll take the big brush,

and very gently hypnotize this,

just work it a little bit, leave it alone.

if you overwork it,
you've killed your cloud

and you've become a cloud killer,

ooh, nothing worse than a cloud killer.

there, fluff it up a little,

and don't worry if you pull little streaks

of paint out when you do that,

because when you hypnotize
it it'll go away.

there, we'll just hypnotize
the whole thing now.

ok let's clean the brush.



there we go.

and let's put one more
little cloud in there.

we'll just have him right
here, just let him work around.

if you're gonna separate these two clouds,

you need the dark area in between,

so don't kill all your darker area.

there, there.

blend him in a little bit, fluff
him up, then hypnotize him.

ok.

now let's start working on
this ridge of mountains here.

and we're gonna take a
little blue and brown,

i wanna make sort of a grey color here,

blue, brown and white.

and your blue is a hundred
times stronger than the brown,

so use it sparingly.

there we go.

now, let's just take in, lay
us in a nice little ridge here,

and we're really pushing
this into the canvas,

work it hard, working hard.

push, you're not gonna hurt that canvas.

just a few little bumps
here and there on top.

we really push that color
into the canvas, there.

now we take the big brush,
and we'll pull this downward.

there we go.

get rid of all that excess paint.

and it's blending with the
magic white as you pull it down,

and automatically it gets lighter in value

toward the bottom.

ok.

ok, let's clean the old brush.



there we are.

now, let's take a little bit of white,

and i'm gonna grey it a little bit,

just to make it a little bit duller.

and over here i'm gonna make
up a little shadow color,

and it's brown, white
and a little bit of blue,

so we can work back and forth

between highlights and shadows.

little bitty, little
little bitty roll of paint

on your knife, almost no paint.

want this to be very subdued.

there we go.

there, just let this come on down,

this should look almost like cliffs.

just with a light striking here and there.

ok.

little bit of the shadow
color played here and there.

i think you'll find that,
doing these kind of mountains,

are a little more difficult
than the other ones

we were doing, where we used more paint.

these here, almost non-existent
when it comes to paint.

ok.

then we'll take the big
brush and diffuse this,

make it even softer, push
it even farther back.

like so.

really pushing back.

ok maybe we'll put a little ridge

coming right around here sorta.

there we go.

you could spend all day
just playing with mountains,

and it's a super, super way to learn,

so, if you have an old
canvas around take it,

and just do nothing but
mountains on it, the whole thing.

it really, really will
make friend of that knife

by the time you're finished.

and it'll help you to
understand mountains,

everybody's not as fortunate
as i who can live in alaska

where you can look out your window

and view mountains that most
people only see in pictures.

alrighty, let's bring this down,

maybe we'll just have
it come right into here.

there we go.

ok, and if you don't have
mountains outside of your window,

you can buy a lot of books
that have pictures in it,

and examples, and after a
very short period of time

you'll begin making these
up in your own mind,

you no longer have to worry about copying,

but copying is a way to start.

in here we're trying
to give you something,

just sorta as a guideline to go by,

and to make your own vision,
and to put it on canvas.

so don't worry about
trying to copy exactly

what i'm doing here, do what you wanna do,

put your feelings into it,
your heart, it's your world.

ok.

and maybe a few little
things here and there.

a few little shadows.

and maybe we'll just
change some of these angles

here a little, there we
go, i like that better.

see it's your mountain, you can change it.

you can change it anyway
you want him to be.

we'll put some little
shadows here and there,

just to make some little
projections coming out,

wherever you want em.

ok.

now, let's diffuse this,
lay it in the mist here.

very soft.

now i must take a little magic
white, little magic white.

we need a thinner paint,

if we're gonna make
some happy little clouds

that just sort of float
down over the mountain here,

and maybe we'll just
take this one right here,

and just let him float right
on down over the mountain.

now, it's essential that you
have a thick paint on first,

it is essential, absolutely necessary,

or all you do is make mud here.

ok maybe there's a little cloud

just floating right down through there.

ok.

we just lay these clouds where we want em.

heck, maybe this one
comes down over here too.

very thin paint, can't stress that enough.

ok.

now, very, very gently,

a hair just about touches,
not quite, just about.

there we go.

and then we'll hypnotize
it, ever so lightly.

super, super lightly, there.

see how easy it is to put clouds

just drifting right over the mountain?



ok.

now then, let's take, let's
take a little sap green,

and a little brown mixed together.

ok let's see here, let's take,

oh got a big old hair, and it
ain't right here on the brush.

if you get a hair on the canvas,

just take the corner of your
brush, and lift it right off.

no big deal.

if you take your finger and start picking

you'll destroy your whole picture

trying to get that one little
son of a gun off there.

ok now, we'll just lay in some color here,

maybe i'll add just a little
touch of blue to that.

yeah, i like that better.

there we go.

ok, now then, we can
take and grab the hold

of a little bit of that, pull it down,

instant reflections, instant reflections.

pull that across.

ok, now we can highlight a little bit,

we'll take a little
bit of the magic white,

a little yellow and a
touch of thalo green.

nice bright little green here.

and, they'll lay in
some nice little things

happening all over the place.

there we go.

ok let's reflect a
little bit of that color

right down into the water here.

ok.

now, let's mix up some
blue, and some brown,

and some sap green, and
you want this very dark,

it looks black.

and, we'll use the
almighty fan brush today,

make some little trees in the background.

we've used just about every brush here,

so just show you how you can make

some beautiful little trees with this.

and you just sort of let
em fall of the brush,

back and forth, shape your
tree, and lay em in there.

maybe we'll put one a little higher,

that way we'll put the cloud,

that little cloud that's floating
in front of the mountain,

we'll put him behind the tree.

there we go.

these are fun little trees
to make, just let em happen.

ok, maybe one over here.

his top got bent a little bit,

maybe airplane went too
close and clipped him.

in alaska that's not unusual,

they have some crazy
old bush pilots up there

that run over everything.

friend of mine brought back a

back of his airplane.

ok maybe a little baby one over here.

ok.

then we'll just pull that
down into the reflections,

very gently,

like so.

alright.

now we'll take some magic white,

and a little bit of van dyke brown,

a little touch of yellow,

just to make sort of a dirt
color, sandy little color,

and we'll lay in some
little waterlines back here.

and maybe we'll have a
little beach comes down.

there, and that just
run around the corner.

ok, there you goes.

we'll take a dry brush, and
we lift this just a touch,

this is a thinner paint
so it'll move on top

of the other without destroying.

ok, now just some straight magic white

and we'll sparkle this up a little bit.

ok.

we'll put a few little sticks
and stems here and there.

ok, time to move forward in this picture.

we'll mix us up a little more dark color.

ok.

let's put some paint
on the one-inch brush,

and build us another tree here.

maybe we got a nice evergreen

that's growing right up through here.

there you go son.

just let him drip out of the brush.

and we'll give him a little friend.

there,

we go, alright.

now, let's just put
some little bushy trees

right in here, like this,

some little reflections underneath.

pull those down.

ok.

and we'll put some
little trunk indicators,

just here and there.

alrighty, now we can highlight that.

and we'll throw a nice
little green bush right here.

there's a nice little tree.

ok,

there.

we'll reflect those right
down into the water.

and give them a little pull.

ok, little van dyke brown,

and we'll put some soil in here,

and we'll just sort of
let this come around.

then a little brown and
white, a highlighty,

make him look like stones and stuff.

few little bushes that
travel down, there we go.

there we go.

ok.

and we'll put a little
waterline under here,

and this is still water
so it has to be flat,

all these lines have to be straight.

go anywhere you wanna go with them

but they have to basically be straight,

or your water's gonna
run out of your picture,

you're gonna have to get a
bucket and put it under one end.

let's put a few little
sticks here and there.

alright.

now, let's take some brown, and do this,

shwip, just let this go.

ok.

really pushing that into the canvas,

really pushing it.

ok.

and we take a little
white, a little brown,

a little touch of blue into it here.

and we'll just do this, shwoo.

turn it into some nice dirt area.

ok.

now then,

let us build a tree right here.

nice tree, there we go.

this is just our dark color
that we've used before,

blue and brown and a little sap green.

maybe we need a little bush
right in here somewhere,

just to break it up.

a little bush out here.

maybe we'll put a little bush right there.

ok.

add in some little trunks.

like so.

and we'll put some little
highlights on here.

ok.





and, there we are.

some little things happening on this bush.

ok.

and we'll have some
little bushes over here.

maybe we have a little path that sort of,

just comes through here.

just a little dark area.

that'll bring it down to it.

ok, let's see what we can do here.

let's have a nice tree right here,

heading on right up through here maybe.

put his other side on,
don't want a one-sided tree.

ok, they go down through here,

just let him fall down wherever.

maybe a little one there.

give them a little highlight.

ok.

and we'll take our dark color,

and we'll put some leaves
on that little rascal.

there.

and we'll just take,

a little more color, and
we'll highlight these.





maybe we'll put a nice bright
little tree right here.

and a few little things down here.

this sort of gives it the indication

that the land works down that way.

ok.

now i wanna put a few little
sticks all throughout here.

like so.

we're just cutting through the paint here.

ok, now we'll take a dark color

and i've used a thin oil here,

and maybe we'll put a few
little things that are just,

sort of, playing around out like so.

just here and there,
wherever you'd like em.

this is your creation.

ok, and we need to have a
old dead limb here and there.

ok maybe i'll just mix up
a dark, dark green here,

we'll just put a few little
highlights on these trees

to indicate little
lights playing on those.

there we go.



ok i think we'll sign that one,

and that one should be
just about finished.

there we are.

i really hope you have
enjoyed this painting,

i hope yours is complete also, if not,

hope you'll be with us next time.

and until we meet again, happy painting,

thank you very much.





- hello, i'm bob ross,
and for the next 13 weeks,

i'll be your host as we
experience the joy of painting.

this is a fantastic method of painting,

where we use the wet-on-wet technique.

and before i go far into the show,

i'd like to take a few
minutes, and make a dedication.

i would like to dedicate this
show to my beloved friend,

and teacher whom we've all
watched and loved for many years,

on public television, bill alexander.

and years ago, bill taught
me this fantastic technique,

and i feel as though he
gave me a precious gift,

and i'd like to share that gift with you.

so, before we start, let's talk a minute

about the equipment that
we'll be using here.

we're using a stretch canvas,
rather than a canvas board.

the canvas board will absorb your

under-paint very rapidly, and become dry.

you need a strong easel,

because we use a lot of pressure here.

and you need an easel that would

grip the canvas and hold it securely.

the palette that we use,

we use a large palette that has

a lot of working area in it.

and i'm going to go over

each of the colors that we use here.

and they'll be flashed across the screen,

so if you need to write them down,

you can pick them up off the
screen as i talk about them.

so, here we go, let's start right up

here with titanium white.

thalo green.

thalo blue.

prussian blue.

burnt umber.

van dyke brown.

alizarin crimson.

sap green.

cad yellow.

yellow ochre.

indian yellow.

and permanent red.

now, these 12 colors we'll use every week.

so, if you wanna have your palette ready,

these are the colors that we'll use.

also, each week, we'll run
the colors across the screen,

so in case you didn't get all of these,

you can pick them up the next time.

the brushes that we use.

these are natural bristle brushes.

i'm using a two and a half
inch and a one inch brush.

also, we use an almighty palette knife.

a very big palette knife.

and this palette knife, unlike
traditional palette knives,

is very firm, it's very big.

so, we can do almighty
things very rapidly here.

so, let's do it.

let's paint an almighty
picture right here.

i'm gonna start by dipping the brush into

a little bit of magic white.

now, this makes the canvas wet,

it makes it slick, it allows
the paint to blend in here.

you actually blend the
painting on the canvas.

so, all we do here is
cover the entire canvas

with a thin layer of the magic white.



alright.

probably the biggest mistake
made when you first start,

is applying too much magic white.

all we want is just a
nice, thin, even coat.



and when you're using large brushes,

this only takes a couple minutes,

so no problem.

there we go.

look it there, already
we're almost complete.

there.

okay, i just work it back and forth,

and up and down to get a nice
even distribution of color.

okay.

just about got this canvas
covered with the magic white.

another big problem that
we run into continually,

is washing the brushes.

now, i'm gonna wash the brush,

and we wash it with
odorless paint thinner.

and i strongly suggest
that you use odorless,

or you'll run everybody in
the house out in the yard.

you'll be there by yourself.

now, you shake the brush into a box,

and then beat the bristles dry.

now, if you do this at home,

this is a quick way to redecorate your

living room in a second, so be careful.

learn how to contain this.

alrighty, let's do a simple
little picture today,

that'll just give you an idea of how this

fantastic technique works.

so, i'm gonna start here with
a little bit of prussian blue.

and we pull a small amount of paint out,

and beat it into the bristles.

really work this paint into the bristles.

you're looking for a nice even

distribution of color
throughout the bristles.

and we'll start right up here at the top,

and we just make little "x's",

little crisscross pattern.

come all the way across the top.

there we go.

now, your brush is picking
up the magic white,

and automatically the
sky is gonna get lighter

in value as it works toward the horizon.

there.

okay, now see how easy that was.

okay.

and very gently, we'll
just blend this out.



now, it's very easy to make a sky darker,

but it's a son of a
gun to make it lighter.

if you wanted to make it a little darker,

all you do is add a little more blue.

a little more blue.

this stuff is really strong.

and go right back through
the same procedure.

you can darken the sky very easily.

alright.

another thing that seems to give

us a lot of problems, is almighty clouds.

so, let's spend a second
here and make us a cloud.

and, here we'll use the fan brush.

and, i'm gonna take the fan brush,

and load it full of titanium white paint.

load it full.

lot of paint in the bristles.

okay, now,

we'll go up here and decide where

we want a happy little
cloud to float around.

and you touch the canvas,

and just make little tiny circles.

just work it, work it, work it.

do it rapidly.

push hard and get away from it.

don't keep working the same area,

all you'll have is a big
cotton ball up in the sky.

okay, maybe we'll put another
little cloud right over here.

just to show you how to
make these little clouds.

okay, now,

with a large brush,

we wanna very gently,

blend this out on the bottom down here.

but, without touching the top at all.

so, very gently, just the bottom.

just blend it a little bit.

little, tiny circles.

there we go.

now over here, we'll
blend this one a little.

now, we'll fluff it.

and, we're just gonna gently lift upward.

and don't worry if you get some of these

little things up in the sky.

okay.

now, very gently, we'll hypnotize that.

there we go.

these are very simple,
very basic little clouds.

and very easy to do.

now, if your brush sheds,
like it just did here,

and you get a hair on here,

just take a corner of
your bush and lift it off.

don't spend all day trying to pick it off,

you'll have fingerprints
all over your painting.

just use a corner of your brush.

alright.



let's now make an almighty mountain.

everybody likes mountains.

no matter if you live
in florida or alaska,

mountains are still pretty.

i'ma take a little bit
of the prussian blue,

some van dyke brown,

and a little touch of crimson,

very little crimson.



and, we'll mix that up real good.

now,

all you need to do here is,

push this almighty knife
right into the canvas.

just push.



you're really pushing the
paint right into the fabric.

there.

and all were looking for is just

a basic outline for this mountain.

and you may have noticed by now,

we use no patterns, we do no sketching.

we let this flow right our
of our heart onto the canvas.

there.

now, with the larger brush,
i'm just gonna pull this down.

one thing about mountains
when you're painting them,

they should always be more distinct

at the top than they are at the bottom.

'cause at the bottom of
the mountain we have mist,

and now we have pollution.

all of these things
diffuse and break up light,

and create the mist at the
bottom of the mountain.

so, once again we allow the magic white

to mix with the paint, and
this happens automatically.

we don't have to worry about it,

or think about it.

let it happen.

alright.

let's put some snow on
this almighty mountain.

we'll use a little of the titanium white.

and we're gonna start
right up here on this peak,

and just let this paint flow
right down the mountain.

and you want the paint to break like this.

so it creates all the
little rocks and stone,

and highlights and
shadows in your mountain.

there.



now,

light's gonna strike right
along this peak also.

and maybe,

just a little touch back in here.

now, let's build some shadows.

and we'll just use a little bit

of the prussian blue, and white.

maybe a touch more.

there we go.



now the shadows will run
in the opposite direction.

we'll start here,

and just let the shadows
run right across like this.

there comes a shadow.

okay, and we'll put one back here.

and, we've decided this peak,

is behind the mountain.

so, all we do is take this shadow,

and bring it right through.

and automatically, you've
just pushed a mountain around.

on this canvas, you're the creator,

anything that you want,
you can build here.

this is your world.

you're dreams come real here.

alright.

there.

now, maybe we'll add just a couple

more little peaks in here.

maybe there's a happy
little peak right here.

we put the highlight in first.

and then we give him his own

private little shadow right there.

now, this is a very basic,
simple little mountain.

and as the series progresses,

we'll do some that are a
little more complicated,

if this is too easy for you.

there we go.

okay.

now, as we had talked about earlier,

we always want it to be more distinct on

the top than it is on the bottom.

so, using the large brush here,

i'm gonna very gently tap
the bottom of the mountain.

i'm tapping, all i wanna do is diffuse.

i don't wanna destroy it.

there we go.

always following the angles.

now, very gently, lift
upward using the brush flat.

look at that.

look at that mist.

see, i knew you could do it.

alright.

i think it's time we had some fun now.

let's get over here into the sap green,

and just load this brush full of paint.

just put a lot of paint into the brush.

just really work it into the bristles.

and,

we're gonna go right along here,

and touch and push.

just push.

just like so.

this is where you need the almighty easel,

because you're really pushing hard here.

you're pushing the paint
right into the fabric.

okay.

there we go.

just push it in.

this is just straight sap green,

and you're bending the bristles.

most important that you bend the bristles.



there.

okay.

now, i'm gonna go into just
a tiny bit of prussian blue.

and we'll darken the front here.

as things get closer
to you in a landscape,

they should get darker in value.

alright.

you know while i'm doin' that,

one of the most interesting
things that we see,

as we run across the country
teaching this fantastic method,

is people continually say, "i
can't draw a straight line."

"i don't have the talent,
bob, to do what you're doing."

that's bologna.

talent is a pursued interest.

in other words, anything that
you're willing to practice,

you can do.

and this is no exception.

but it's like driving the car.

at first, it's a little difficult.

you have to learn how to make your hands

and your foots work together.

same thing, and that's what
we're trying to teach you here,

is the technique.

once you have the technique down,

all you need's a dream in your heart

and the desire to put it on canvas.

okay.

now,

let's go back here in the
background a little bit.

and, we'll mix up some blue,

this is prussian blue.

brown, van dyke brown,
in about equal parts.

and sap green.

all three of these are
in about equal parts.

and it should look very dark,

it should look black on your palette.

okay.

now, with the fan brush here.

we'll make some, let's
make some little evergreens

back here in front of
this almighty mountain.

and there's many, many ways to make them,

and we'll try to show you a bunch

of ways during this series.

okay, we load the fan brush full of paint,

and decide where you want your tree to be.

you touch the canvas,

turn the brush sideways,

and just begin building a tree.

back and forth.

isn't that easy?

looka there.

and, trees get lonely too,

they need a little friend,

so we'll give him a friend right here.

there.

and you know, sometimes,

you don't wanna a bunch of distinct trees,

you just want indications of trees,

so watch right here.

this is the way to make indications.

all we're doing is touching,

just touching.

and this looks like little trees,

when the painting's
finished it is way, way,

they're way back in the background.

and maybe over here.

just drop these in.

this is, this is such a
free style of painting.

there.

and maybe there's some here
that are a little closer.

there, we'll just drop them in,

let them, let them just fall
right off your fan brush.

there we go.

there we go.



okay, we'll put a little
more dark in here.

you need dark in order to show light,

so here i'm just applying
a little dark color.

now,

another golden rule that
you need to remember here.

a thin paint will stick to thick paint.

so, i'm adding just a touch of magic white

on my brush here to go
through this thicker paint.

and this will make it a little bit thinner

so it'll stick on top of the thick paint.

this is why we're,

we're able to paint wet-on-wet.

okay, now, let's put
some happy little things

happening back in here.

just some little bushes and stuff,

here they come, down the hill.

just let them progress.

there we go.

there.

look at all them little rascals.

okay.

with a knife here, i'm
just using the point,

and i'll scratch a few
little trunks here and there.



see, already it looks like we have a

multitude of trees and stuff back here.

okay.

now, let's move a little
forward in the painting.

and, i'm gonna come right about here.

there we go.

and we'll drop a bigger tree in here.

there he goes.

there he is.

there.

these little trees live in your fan brush,

and you have to scare them out sometime.

there.

see, i knew you could do it.



just let that come right on down.

maybe there's some trees on
the other side over here too.

let's, let's put an
almighty tree right here.

we're having such a lot
of fun doing these trees,

we might as well just
keep going with them.



okay.

and by now, you're probably saying,

"hey, can he do anything but evergreens?"

alright, let's do some
different types of trees.

and, we'll take a one inch brush

and load some of the
same color on it here.

and let's put in,

some leafy trees.

there we go.

just push them right off your brush.

bend the bristles.

most, most important that
you bend the bristles.

see you get all the
actions that happen there.

okay, and maybe over
here a nice little tree.

there.

there we go.

now, let's put a little trunk in here.

i'll use a little bit of burnt umber,



and let's just lay some
happy little trunks.

okay, in the little evergreen trees.

just here and there.

there we go.

and maybe a trunk in this
big ol' tree over here.

like so.

one in there.

you can also take just
the point of your knife,

and scratch right through the paint,

and put all kinds of
little indications in here.



alright.

a little more of the thin paint,

to thin this down.

and we'll put some happy
little highlights on there.

maybe we'll say this is,

this looks like fall, so let's
use some bright colors here.

and they show up good on your set at home.

look at that son of a gun.

okay, now,

there we go.

alright, now,

down at the bottom, down here,

we need some nice little
bushes that are happening.

one thing to be very careful of,

don't kill all your dark areas.

if you kill them,

your painting becomes very flat.

there we go.

and, maybe there's a happy
little bush right here.

and a big ol' one here.

big tree here.

alright.

maybe a little something underneath here,

just to give it a little more depth.

there we go.

now, we'll cut a few more

little sticks and twigs here and there.



and this helps create
depth in the painting.

it shows different planes.

the more planes you can show,

the deeper the painting will be.

so, we'll just cut a few of them in here.

you know, it's interesting,

i was doing this painting
one time at a mall,

and i had a man come along, and he says,

"you know i've been to that location."

he says, "except it had
a little pond right here,

"if it had a little pond there,

"i'd buy that painting from you."

so i told him, i said, "you
start writing the check,

"and by the time the check's done,

"you'll have a little pond."

so, watch right here,
let's see what happens.

all you do is take this almighty brush,

and pull down.

and we'll create a
little pond right there.

it's that easy.

there we go.



and i'm gonna take a little
bit of prussian blue,

just to make this pond
a little bit deeper.

i wanna have enough room for
the trout to live in here.

just a little bit deeper.

this is one thing that's

so fantastic about this style of painting.

right, right in mid-stream,
you can change your mind,

you can, you can, completely,

completely change a
painting in just a second.

and here, i'm just pulling across

to make it look like water.

isn't that something?

now, we'll take just a tiny
bit of the magic white,



and we'll put a little waterline in here.



there.

just act like you're trying to cut a hole,

right through the canvas.

and, let's take,

and,

i sort of wiped out a couple
of these little bushes here.

so, let's just put them back in.

and maybe on each side there,

we have some nice little bushes.

okay.

now, i'm gonna add just a tiny bit,

of the van dyke brown,

and the burnt umber to this
magic white to make it,

it's a very, very thin paint.

and with that, we'll just take and

pull down here a little bit.

and make us a nice little bank here.

just some, just some ground for the,

bushes and trees here to set on.

don't want them to fall off in the water,

make a big splash.

that'd disturb that old
trout that lives in there.

there.

now, maybe highlight it with
just a tiny bit of white.

and, this is a very, very gentle touch.

just enough to get the
paint to come off the knife.

there we go.

isn't that something?

now, with just a little
touch more of magic white,

we'll put a little
waterline right under here.



there it is.

just enough to separate this.

there.

a few more little sticks here and there,

just to break it up.

maybe there's some little
grassy things that's sort of

worked down onto the bank here.

just here and there.

over here ought to be some.

what happens if you change you mind again?

son of a gun.

let's change it again.

i'ma take the big brush and

go right back into this dark
color and begin pushing,

like so.

and we'll just add another
plane to the painting,

and make it even deeper.

just push this dark in there.

once again, we need the dark
in order to show the light.

okay, now we got our dark in there.

now, we can highlight it.

little more of the thin white here,

so we can thin this down,
and it sticks nice and easy.

we use a little yellow ochre
mixed with a little cad yellow.

and mix it on your brush,

that way you get a multitude
of things that happen.

maybe a little of the permanent red,

let's put...

oh!

there's a little fireball.

that's a nice one.

and, right on down through like so.

and just let these flow
with the lay of the land.

and put all kind of little,

look at all those little grassy things.

there they go.

just as easy.

okay,

now,

we'll just cut a few little
sticks here and there.

there we are.

you know one of the hardest

things to do when you're painting,

is to know when in the world to stop.

it's just, it's such a
temptation to add one more stick,

or one more tree.

and there comes a time
when you have to stop,

or you piddle it to death.

so,

i think we're gonna stop on that one.

show you how to sign a painting.

this is something that gives
people a lot of trouble.

and i'm gonna dip,

this is a number two script liner.

and i'm gonna dip it into
a little bit of thin oil.

and then, use the liner brush

and make the paint so it's like water.

very, very thin.

then it'll flow right on top of there.

and turn this brush, twist it.

that brings it to a
nice, firm, sharp point.

okay.

now,

let's sign it right here.

and, all we do is touch,

and just let this paint flow,

right off this little liner brush.

there we go.

and, luckily, i have a very simple name.

it's easy to spell, and only takes a

second to sign a painting.

and next week,

i hope you have your canvas on your easel,

and you're all ready to go with us.

and, we'll be doing a
white canvas next week.

during the series,

we're gonna do numerous different things.

there will be several paintings

that we do on a black canvas.

oh, there'll be some
that you won't believe,

but next week, have a white canvas ready.

you have the colors.

and we'll be looking for you here,

and until then,

from all of us here.

we'd like to wish each
and every one of you,

happy painting and god bless.



oh

hello i'm bob ross and i'd like to

welcome you to the joy of painting this

is a wet on wet painting technique in

each week i'll take you step-by-step

through a beautiful oil painting if

you've been with us before i'm glad to

see you again if this is your first time

with us drag up your paints in your big

brush come along and paint with us and

let's go ahead and get started and talk

a little bit about what we're going to

do up here i've already covered the

canvas with a thin even coat of liquid

white and this makes the canvas wet

makes it slick it allows us to blend

color right here on the canvas and now

i'm going to have them graphically run

all the colors across the screen that

you need to paint this project with me

it'll come across in the same order that

i have them on the palette starting with

a titanium white and working around

while they're doing that let's go on up

here and get started then we'll start

with a two inch brush today and go right

into a small amount of alizarin crimson

and just really tap the brush into the

color just tap it this assures a nice

even distribution of paint all the way

through the bristles okay let's go up

here let's go right in here and just

make little little criss-cross strokes

little x's and put in a little tiny bit

of pink just like so using very little

pressure just apply it right on the

canvas don't want that to get too bright

we don't want to set this guy on fire we

just want a little pinkish glow in this

guy okay now then i'll take the same old

dirty brush add a little more the

crimson and a tiny tiny bit of phthalo

blue proportionately we want much much

more crimson than blue i'm just mixing

this right on the brush to make a nice

lavender color that's purplish color

okay let's go up here and sort of test

it now sort of test it up here if it's

not the color you want

stop and change it you can fix it this

is your world and you can create any

type of illusion that you want here

you're the boss on this canvas you can

do anything anything okay a little more

paint

i just sort of let that play around when

a little more blue to that tiny bit more

blue there today i thought we're doing

nice painting it's very soft and very

quiet you know it'll make you happy it's

a very easy little painting there we go

that's down here i'll just clean the

brush off just like so okay then let's

clean our brush we clean our brushes

with odorless thinner and be sure it's

odorless earth

you'll be working by yourself shake off

the excess right down here i have a box

i shake the brush into then this is

where you take out all your frustrations

maybe the absolute most fun of this

whole technique okay now let's take the

clean brush and go right back up here

and just blend the sky together still

using little crisscross strokes still

using them back and forth back and forth

there we go

okay and you can blend this to any

degree of softness that you want you can

blend it till you lose all the little

variations that you have personally i

like to leave some of those in there but

when you're doing your painting you look

at it

and you do it the way that you want it

okay there we go and that quickly we

have a very effective little sky and

we'll just use long strokes here to take

out any brush marks okay and that gives

us a happy little sky now then let's

take a little bit of the phthalo blue

and the alizarin crimson we'll just mix

it together still we have a little bit

more of the crimson when we do blue

we're still working with a nice lavender

color pull it out very flat and then cut

across it so it's a small roll of paint

right on the edge of the knife there you

go okay let's go right up here maybe

there's a happy little mountain that

lives right along here you're really

pushing this paint right into the fabric

really get firm with it you're not gonna

hurt this canvas shoot they make tents

out of this tough really push it in use

a lot of pressure a lot pressure

holy the only thing you worried about is

this nice outside shape here you could

care less what's happening down here and

it gives us a basic little little

mountain shape now then let's go back to

our large brush and grab that and pull

it just pull it now that's mixing with a

liquid white and automatically it gets

lighter toward the base and if you can

see the entire mountain it should be

lighter at the bottom than it is at the

top and as we've said on previous shows

because at the bottom you have mist and

now we have pollution and these things

have a tendency to break up and diffuse

light so it looks softer at the bottom

now by just taking the knife here we can

create the illusion of highlights and

shadows just push very firmly you can

take the least little touch of titanium

white we want these mountains to be far

far away so they don't have much detail

just very barely touch smallest amount

of the titanium white and i'm rubbing it

jane let's put a little tiny bit right

there then we can just rub that right

him

simi creates the illusion of all kind of

things happening without you actually

doing a whole bunch it keeps that

mountain looking like it's far far away

far away far away there we go maybe a

little touch right in there wherever you

just make a decision in your mountain

and put it wherever you want it and then

we can tap that you blend it a little

bit and that mountain should look just

like it's just laying there and just

floating in the sky

very soft very quiet okay let's have

some fun now maybe there's a little

footy hill that lives right down here so

we'll just keep using this old two inch

brush i'm going to take a little blue a

little bit of crimson and i'll just mix

them right on the brush we'll add a tiny

little bit of white in there too so

we've got lisbon crimson little bit of

phthalo blue touch it white okay and i'm

just tapping the brush just happen it

lets go right back up here maybe there's

a little foothill that lives right here

and all you needs just the corner of the

brush and just begin laying in some

basic shapes

yeah i sort of let your brush touch and

pull downward touch pull down straight

down straight down and maybe they come

right on down here wherever you want a

little more pain there we go there they

are just right on down and then i want

to create the illusion of mist right

under the bottom of this foothill so

i'll take a clean two inch brush and

we'll come right here and tap firmly if

you can hear that tapping very firmly

and that'll create the illusion of mist

at the base of these foothills just like

so and then very lightly lift upward

just lift straight up straight up and

flick it out okay maybe tell you what

maybe there's another layer of foothills

in there so let's go right into the same

color lizard crimson phthalo blue but i

wanted a little bit darker this thing is

get closer to you to landscape they

should get a little darker and value

okay let's go right back here let's

start right here and maybe we'll just

bring this one down and let it drop

there it is there it is just right on

down right on down see it's a little bit

darker so it stands out might even had

the smallest smallest touch of sap green

to that the smallest touch i just want

to begin giving the indication of a

little green far far back here okay then

we'll take our clean dry brush and once

again i want to create that illusion to

mist down here at the bottom so we tap

it very firmly very firmly and you're

using just this area you can see see

just the top corner of the brush strike

the canvas

like so that's like it that easy you

have missed the bottom left foot hill

and then lift up right there and got

something okay

we'll wash the old brush here i like to

wash the brush that's the most fun part

course everybody's studio is covered

okay now then let's begin putting some

little things that are happening we we

back in the distance i'm going back into

this lavender color i made and add a

tiny tiny bit of sap green just the

smallest amount and all i'm doing is

tapping the still tapping okay let's go

right up here that may be back in here

we back in here it's just a little soft

he'll lives we back here very gentle

there and we're going to put layer after

layer after layer of little hills back

here now if you live in the carolinas or

someplace that have the beautiful

beautiful hills this is a super way to

make them you can make all those

beautiful mountains that you have in

that area the same way just leave this

big one out there we go a little bit

more color on the brush maybe i take

what maybe there's one it comes from

this direction

want to add a little touch more blue in

there there later that's better now we

wanted to get a little darker as they

get closer so all we're doing is just

tapping very gently okay okay little

more the green into that color and you

have to make all mighty decisions here

maybe this one comes right down there it

is look at that see now each time you do

this you're creating planes in here and

each plane that you add into your

painting makes your painting look deeper

it shows much more depth in it and of

course we're not interested in that

almighty dollar but if you should be

that's what sells the painting there we

go there we go see just layer after

layer after layer i tell you what let's

have some fun let's have some fun let me

grab a fan brush here and we'll mix up

same old color a little blue ezreal

crimson and then went ahead a little bit

of white to that little bit of white

there we go

a little bit more than crimson good okay

a white with a knife off now we're gonna

load this fan brush full of paint just

really load it full wig lead in there

okay let's go right up here maybe back

here lives a happy little tree a little

evergreen tree now just sort of touch it

to give you a center and then give it a

little upward push sometimes we make

evergreens by pushing down sometime by

pushing up or today i thought we'd do it

upward look at all the little things

happen there

look at that look at that cute little

tree and we don't want him to get lonely

so let's give him a happy little friend

his little friend lives right there

trees need friends too

they all all need a friend there yes

okay and you know what happens if

there's two trees sooner or later

i have little saddle the guns are gonna

get together here's a little tree he

lives right here beside him just like so

okay and you're painting you put as many

trees as you want i'm gonna put three

right there

maybe i tell you what let's have a

little tree a little tiny tree there's

right there and we make him the same way

only smaller just make him in the

smaller and go out and study trees make

friends with trees you know i talked

about going out in the woods and mm-hmm

and sitting around the dog eating trees

there's nothing wrong with that that's

the way you learned what makes a tree

look like a tree spend some time with

nature let it become your good friend

i'll put some more trees or a doubt in

there see there you'll just put trees

wherever you want them tell you what

let's do let's take this brush and see

right here at the base i'm gonna take

his brush and just begin picking up some

of that color and tapping all i'm doing

is tapping i'm going to begin adding a

little color to that little yellow ocher

little cad yellow just very lightly and

being again creating little highlights

on all these little hills so that i'm

all blend together just a nice soft

little meadow back here add a little

indian yellow here in there a little

touch of bright red tiniest little

amount of the red toe

there we go just just a highlight a

little don't get carried away all right

okay and i'm just sort of mixing all of

these yellows and red's together on the

brush there we are there see how that

begins to soften and increase the

illusion of depth that's what we're

looking for all right i'll tell you what

let's go back into this same old color

the blue and the crimson and the white

get the old brush all loaded up here a

lot of paint tiles go back up here maybe

in here some more little trees just give

it a little push upward and once again

in your painting you put as many or as

few trees as you want but the more you

make the more practice you get and if

there's a secret to painting it's

practice it's practice the more you

paint the easier it becomes it's like

anything else when you first first

started tying your shoe probably

probably didn't work first time you had

to practice it a few times and now you

can do it without even looking it was

the same way with painting pretty soon

you can do it and it's almost oh it just

happens you don't have to worry about

how to load this brush you can spend

your thinking time worrying about

composition and and begin looking at

things in the painting that's when it's

fine that's when you truly experience

the joy of painting maybe tell you what

maybe right here this old tree he didn't

make it in nature you have trees that oh

maybe maybe somebody stepped on him when

he's little and they got a little uh

little herd in them and they died but

you had dead trees in nature too so put

some of those in your painting it makes

them look real okay we'll just drop it

not a little tree of two okay then once

again we just grab the bottom of that

and let it go tap it then we can take

our liner brush you know use a little

bit of the liquid black on it just put a

little indication here and there have a

fuel fuel looms that are still hanging

off these dead trees back here and that

easy

we got her okay

yeah then takes more blue and some more

crimson there we go all right

let's let's come right down here and

here comes another hill and all we're

doing is initially laying in the base

color a dark color just like so don't

cover it completely leave some of these

areas that are light in here these will

create all kinds of beautiful effects

when you're finished and as you know if

you've painted with us before we don't

make mistakes we have happy accidents so

learn to work with these things anything

that happens learn to use it learn to

use it let it be your friend sometimes

you have a tendency to fight painting

and just just work with whatever happens

whatever happens here we go seeing you

begin again creating the curvature of

the land here or the lay of the land

just sort of let your mind wander and

enjoy painting should make you happy

should really make you happy there you

know the one thing if painting teaches

you nothing else it teaches you to look

at nature i get letters every day for

fantastic people that say baba i've

looked at the tree in my front yard ever

since it was a little baby and i've

never really seen until i started

painting and that's true that's so true

painting it teaches you to see to

appreciate pretty soon here you're

heading down the street and you say oh

my gosh look at that tree a trees made

of sap green with a little blue in it or

that cloud can be done with a fan brush

of course you had to be careful you're

wrecked a car when you're doing things

like yeah but okay i'm going to add the

least little touch of white and a little

bit of red right on the brush just

tapping it in just tapping okay maybe

there's a little light that plays right

through here what is to be a little

bright area right in there so i'm gonna

do is just sort of tap that on it maybe

like right there right there

all right there i'm just taking go right

into a little bit of yellow and a little

green to that and i'm using all the

yellows here little touch of the red

touch of the reasons very strong okay

let's go back up here now then we can

begin just tapping on some highlights

here see

and begin once again begin thinking

about the lay of the land

just sort of let it flow because on this

piece of canvas you can create anything

anything there we go see now if you want

to create little hills it should be

brighter on top than it is down here and

that gives you illusion of a little hill

like a light striking apparently to get

darker darker darker darker as it works

down there you go hmm

you know i've painted thousands and

thousands of paintings and i still get

excited when i see at work

it's so fantastic and i don't look at

all the little hills and little ridges

and you can do it you can do it see a

little bright areas just it just shows

up little sun striking right through

there pretty when it's done in touch

right there okay less really has some

fun yeah i'm gonna go right into the the

midnight black and i'm gonna add a

little bit of van dyke brown just mix it

right on the brush a lot of paint a lot

of paint okay let's go up here maybe

there's some some big trees that live in

here and i think one lives right there

and all i'm gonna do is just tap just

tap to come right down like so

just tap it in and i have several fan

brushes going here so i don't have to

wash them take a little bit of the white

right on this brush and watch here we're

gonna come right down this edge right

down the edge and we'll put some

highlight right on that tree and that

easy that easy you have a nice strong

tree trunk oh that was fun let's do

another let's do another insane color

little brown black

now you had to make a decision where is

the trees live in your painting i know

right there dairy cows

and all these trees aren't perfectly

straight like telephone poles let them

let them have a little character trees

are like people each one has has its own

individual personality oh field or to be

one right there right across the

mountain every tree is different

once again spend some time with nature

go out and go out and talk to a tree

don't matter people thank you crazy us

painters you know they think we're a

little weird anyway that's all right

that's all right tell you what maybe

okay right here we'll have a smaller

tree that lives right here on this

little hill we'll push him back i can't

can't go over the other side here we

don't want this side to have all the

trees so we'll put there's one right

there

oop just drop it off this is just black

with brown huh big one right there big

ole tree a little more of the brown

bagel tree he comes right down my cabin

hey there

okay easy they were to make and we'll

take our other fan breast it has the

white on it and very quickly you can

just go right along here and dis drop on

a little bit of highlight remember which

side the lights coming from and if

you're right-handed

it's normally easier to have the light

coming from the right

left-handed it'll vary from person to

person okay let's go right along here

mmm let's drop on some little things

like so 10 specs though hmm can't let's

take a liner brush and i'm gonna put a

little bit of the liquid black out here

on my palate take our liner brush and

i'm add a little tiny bit of thinner to

it so it's a very thin turn that brush

bring it to a nice point let's go right

here now then here and there just drop

on a few happy little limbs little arms

on the trees yeah trees got some arms

see just wherever you think they should

live you know pine trees always have old

broken ones all over look at that look

at that this is just liquid black with a

little bit of thinner here and you can

put as many or as few as you want if you

back in here we don't want this old tree

to be left out there here we go okay

let's go over here

put a little bit ah right there right

there but this is a very nice painting

if it's your first painting project it's

works very well if you've painted with

me before it's a paint you'll give you a

lot of fun but there gives us a few

indications of some limbs yeah then

let's take let's take the old fan brush

i'm gonna use some of the black still

and we'll drop a few little leaves on

these trees okay let's go right up here

now we touch and give it a little upward

push make little smiley faces yeah sort

of

make a decision where you think they

live off of me drop em in

maybe look here a few on this old tree

plus like that let's put a few in this

little tree leave some of the old trunk

showing some on this one hmm all kinds

of things happening and just let them go

yes let them go

i'll give this trees out there si all

kinds of leaves here and that's some of

the sky show through and i'm over right

into a little bit of the sap green with

a touch of yellow on it and come back

and very gently i like some of these and

that easy you have a beautiful tree and

i think with that we just about have a

finished painting so i think we'll call

that one done and from all of us here

i'd like to wish you happy painting

god bless and we'll see you next time

oh

you



- hello, i'm bob ross

and i'd like to welcome you to

the 27th series of the joy of painting.

if this is your first time with us,

allow me to extend a
personal invitation for you

to drag out your paints

and some big, ol' unorthodox brushes

and i'll show you how to do
some fantastic little landscapes

that you can do.

so i'll tell you what,

today let's start out and
have 'em run all the colors

across the screen that you need

to paint this little painting with us,

and while they're doing
that let me show you

what i've gotten done up here.

today, i've taken an

pre-stretch canvas and i've
just covered the entire canvas

with black gesso.

and black gesso is just an acrylic paint

that makes the canvas black.

i've allowed that to dry completely.

on top of that, take a little
piece of contact paper here,

any sticky back paper

cut an oval, stuck it on there.

then on the inside here,

after we have the contact paper on,

i've taken a little bit of liquid clear

and covered the entire inside.

then we've taken alizarin crimson,

just plain ol' alizerin crimson
covered the entire canvas.

and on the corner over
here i've put a little bit

of phthalo blue, just so it's sort of a

lavender color over here.

i know it sounds complicated
but believe it or not

it is extremely simple.

black gesso, liquid clear,

alizarin crimson, a little
phthalo blue in the corner

and just blend it out.

and with that let me show
you how much fun we can have.

let's start today with a

least little bit of indian yellow.

i just want a very small amount.

just a small amount.

and i'll go right up in here and get

a little bit of white on there.

so we have a little indian yellow

and a little bit of titanium white

on a little two inch brush.

let's go right up in here.

now, let's decide where
our light area will be,

and right in here let's
start making little x's,

little criss cross strokes,
something like that.

and we just begin letting that blend

outward and upward.

i want this to be the
lightest area in my sky.

so with that, all we have to
do is start making little x's.

little more paint on the brush,

and we just continue to blend.

isn't that fantastic?

i love these black canvasses

because you put the
transparent color on there,

they still look black,

but when you start painting

you add a little white, or
yellow or something in there,

and they come alive.

notice that i'm always
taking the pure color

back to the lightest
area and working outward.

that way we assure that the lightest color

is right in there, and
that's where we want it.

alright.

look at all those beautiful colors,

they just... they happen automatically.

this is a very, very
easy style of painting.

anybody can do this.

i get letters everyday from people

all over the country.

they say, "i never believed i could paint,

but i've tried what you
showed me on television

and it works for me.

it works."

alright.

now i want to make that
a little brighter yet.

so i'm going to take some
more of the titanium white

and a little bit of canyon yellow,

it's very bright yellow,
very strong yellow.

just a little.

now i'll go right up in here,

and just above there,

add a little bit of that.

there.

just, still making little x's
with the criss-cross strokes.

something about like
that, let it blend upward.

once again, always start
in the lightest area

and work outward,

because you're gonna pick
up this transparent color

this on the canvas and automatically

it will get darker and
darker as you work away

from that center area.

something about like so.

there.

we'll take the little blender brush

and come back and smooth
all that out in a second.

in the meantime i'm going
to grab another brush.

i have several of them
going so i don't have

to spend all my time just washing brushes.

take a little white and let's get crazy,

shoot, let's get a little
bit of this bright red.

that's a gorgeous color
but it's very strong.

be careful with it.

just a tap a little into the bristles,

that's all we're doing, just tapping.

and maybe up here now we'll...

maybe... yep.

there's some, just some
happy little things

that happen up here in the sky.

just little things like this,

and we'll dance a few
little colors in here.

in your world you put any color

or any shape that you want.

painting is a very individual thing.

everybody will see nature
through different eyes

and that's the beauty of it.

you can paint any world
that you want here.

any world that you want.

maybe there's a little
dooer comes out here,

i don't know,

doesn't really matter.

you decide.

take a little blue, a little crimson,

just mix them on the brush here.

make sort of a little lavender color

but to the reddish side.

now the blue is many, many
times stronger than the crimson,

so proportionately you need
much, much more crimson

than you do blue.

then i'm just gonna begin laying in some

little colors under in here
and wherever we want them.

just have fun with this, let it happen.

let it happen.

we don't do any drawings or tracings,

we really learn to create here.

we let our imagination take us

to worlds we never knew existed,

and in those worlds we find peace,

we find happiness.

good things happen here.

little blender brush,
it's a very soft brush.

very soft.

make a nice, nice makeup brush even.

but with that, because
the paint we use here

is very firm and very dry,

very thick paint,

we can take this little
blender and go right over it.

just like that.

isn't that something?

that easy.

there, we can just work on this a little,

and the more you blend this

the more it just goes right
into those background colors

and gorgeous things happen automatically.

automatically.

put a little white paint on there,

maybe we'll brighten that
a little, right in there.

i want that to stand out.

something about like that.

alright.

okay.

now that, it's time to
have some fun in here.

let's get a little fan brush,

take a fan brush.

i'm gonna mix up,

we'll take some alizarin crimson,

a little bit of the phthalo blue,

maybe even put a little black in there.

like that.

i'm gonna get a little titanium white.

i'm looking for sort of a... mmm...

that color.

that color right there.

sort of a grey,

grey to the blue side.

okay?

let me wipe the knife off.

let me just wipe the knife
of a little paper towel.

take the fan brush,

and we'll load both sides full of color

just by going back and forth.

alright.

now then up in here, maybe
in our world back in here

lives some little evergreen trees.

and sometimes you can make
gorgeous little tree indications,

just taking a little fan
brush and pushing upward,

just push it upward.

we'll make all kinds of little trees.

i'm gonna add the least
little touch of white there

so it stands out a little better,

so for television it shows up.

there.

that shows up a little better.

but in your world you make them

any degree of darkness or
lightness that you want.

there we go.

wherever, wherever.

and did you know, if you've
painted with me before,

we don't make mistakes.

we have happy accidents.

and all that means is
that very soon you learn

to work with anything that
happens on this piece of canvas.

literally anything that happens.

because sometimes things that
you think are big mistakes

and you're really worried about,

when the painting's
finished they end up being

the highlight of the entire painting.

there.

and each painting will
teach you something.

learn from it.

as long as you learn from an experience

then it's not wasted.

it's not wasted.

it's only wasted when
you accept it as failure.

and we don't have any failure here.

we don't have any.

it's against the rules.

in bob's world, that's against the rules.

now then, i'll go back
to a two inch brush,

be sure it's clean and dry,

and i want to create the illusion of mist

down at the base of this.

so all we do, firmly, with
the top corner of the brush,

just tap.

just tap it.

that's really and truly
all there is to it.

then we're gonna lift slightly upward,

just enough to take out
the little tap marks

and sort of blend everything
together and make it very soft.

now, it looks like a little
row of trees that lives

wee wee back here in
the distance somewhere.

just happy little trees.

now, i'm going to go into
crimson, blue, and black

same colors

but this time i'm gonna add much much less

of the white color to it.

much less.

there, i want it to be quite a bit darker.

in a landscape painting, as you know,

as things get closer to you

they should get darker
and darker in value.

this is sort of a lavender color.

load both sides of the ol' fan brush,

and let's put another row of trees.

another thing that you find when

you're doing landscapes,

the more plains or the more
areas that you have in here,

the deeper that your painting will look.

that's what gives a
painting depth, distance.

that's what will make your
painting very, very special.

when people look at it they'll
say, "oh i can look in there

and see forever."

there.

and that's what does it.

maybe this comes,

yeah, why not?

right up in here.

something like that.

and we're just looking
for indications for trees.

these are too far away
to see a lot of detail.

we'll put a little detail
on them but not much.

not much,

we get too much detail it
will ruin that illusion

of distance in your painting.

and that's a good friend.

we want that.

alright,

now if you want to give
a few of these trees

the indication of a little
more detail, just do that.

take the corner of the fan brush

and make it look like here and there,

and there and here,

there's a big strong tree
that lives up in here.

maybe he got more sunlight or more water,

and he grew big.

just wherever you think they should be.

just drop them in.

like that.

shoot, i think we about have that.

maybe a couple over on this side.

but that easy, we can make a
pretty nice little background.

go back to our little two inch brush here

tap a little on the bottom,

just enough to create
that misty illusion again.

very lightly.

very lightly.

lift upward.

very lightly.

something like that.

you know for many years i
was a traditional painter,

and one of the things, when
i was a traditional painter,

that was extremely difficult
was making reflections,

and in this technique it's
one of the easiest, nicest,

most effective things that happened.

watch here.

come right up in here.

all you have to do is
touch the canvas with

a little titanium white,

we have color on the canvas already

and pull it straight down.

it's important to come
straight down though.

straight down.

it'll pick up all those
gorgeous transparent colors

that we had underneath there.

that easy.

and very gently, we go across.

just like that.

see there?

and instantly it begins
looking like water.

time to wash the ol' brush.

if you've painted with me before,

you know this is really the whole thing,

it's the most fun part
of the entire procedure.

shake it off.

and just beat the devil out of it.

i thought maybe today we'd
have a little snow scene.

i'll show you a very
easy way of making snow.

very easy way.

we'll just take titanium white

we use that same ol' two inch brush.

this is one of the simplest ways

of making very nice snow.

tap it.

if you've painted with me before

this is the way we make
little grassy areas,

but i want to make snow
that looks powdery,

like, well skiers call it powder so

sometimes snow looks like that.

all you do is just tap.

just tap.

something like so.

very gently.

there.

see?

that's all there is to it.

all there is to it.

all you're doing is
just tapping the canvas.

and we'll go back to this very, very soft

blender brush.

it's very soft.

get a clean one

and gently

just graze it just enough

to bring it together.

and it'll give that
indication of very soft snow.

watch here,

watch here, watch here.

i get excited.

i've probably painted a
million pictures, i think,

and i still get excited with this.

maybe in our world

maybe this tree

watch here

you can grab trees and pull
them into the foreground.

this easy.

just gonna take that tree

bring it right on down

and we'll bring it right here

so it pushes that little snowbank back.

it goes back behind it now.

it works so good in me we'll
have one over here, too.

i like that.

i like that.

and this is your world so you can do

anything that you want here.

any ol' thing that you want,

there it goes.

have one there.

let's give him a friend.

i like to make evergreen trees.

they work so well and
they're a lot of fun,

and they're gorgeous.

absolutely gorgeous.

now we can go back to our ol' brush here

that has the titanium white on it,

load a little bit.

and you work in layers.

see we did the thing that
was in the background first.

and now we'll begin working forward,

forward, forward.

always starting with
the most distant object

and working forward.

there we go.

on the other side we'll do the same thing,

we'll bring it right underneath this tree.

just right on out,

a little join together there.

there.

alright.

but isn't that a super easy way

of doing a very effective illusion?

just making snow?

back to our little blender brush.

very lightly.

two hairs and some air.

very lightly, just blend that.

now we have that white on the brush,

let's go back and
reinforce this reflection.

i want to make it a little brighter

so it jumps out at you.

just like that.

and go across.

just like that.

now then,

just take a little bit
of the liquid white.

liquid white is just an oil based medium.

and we use it to thin paint,

we use it to cover the canvas,

and we use it to make water lines.

just cut across, can you see that?

just cut across with a knife.

and we go right up in here

and let's just cut in a little water line

that lives right there.

right there.

that's all there is to it.

these water lines should be
basically straight though.

by that i mean going
back and forth across,

because if they're not straight your water

look like it's gonna run
right out of the painting.

you might have to tie a bucket on the side

to catch the overflow.

there.

maybe down in here
there's a little ripple.

whatever.

whatever.

it's up to you.

totally and completely.

there we are.

like that.

now then,

you ready to get crazy?

let's do it.

let's have some big fun.

let's take a phthalo
blue and alizarin crimson

and no white,

it's just blue and crimson.

i'm making a very deep lavender
that should look black.

tap the bristles of the brush firmly

into the paint.

give it a little push.

and time to get crazy,

this is your bravery test.

maybe we've got a big tree.

you know me, i like big trees.

yep, there it is.

there it is.

it lives right up here.

and i'm using, just mainly
the corner of the brush

oops went right over that tree.

that's alright, we know he's back there.

maybe, maybe, maybe in our world

maybe there's a big bush.

you're right, he lives right there.

just sort of make these
things up in your mind

and let them go whever you want them.

maybe there's...

maybe there's a whole
little group of bushes

that live here.

i don't know.

a little bunny rabbit has
to have a place to hide.

and that's a pretty good one right there.

we can take our liner brush,

use a little of the dark sienna,

and i'm thinning the paint because

one of our golden rules is

a thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

thin will stick to thick.

taken this dark sienna, a
little bit of white in it,

just enough to dilute it a little.

and here and there we're gonna just put in

an indication of a few
little tree trunks and sticks

and twigs that live back.

not looking for a lot of detail.

not yet.

we're gonna put some
detail in the foreground

but not yet.

and we'll probably cover most of those up

but a few of them's gonna show through

and it'll look like you worked
yourself to death up there

trying to get all those.

let's go into a little
white and a little touch,

a little touch,

of phthalo blue with it.

just enough to cool it.

not much.

titanium white, but push it,

push it.

you can see that little
ridge of paint right there.

there's one just like it on your brush

and that's what we end up painting with.

push it, about a 45 degree angle.

now very lightly, using just
the corner of the brush,

just begin tapping in all kinds
of little things in there.

okay, maybe we need to load

a little more paint on the brush.

now if you have trouble making a stick,

add the least little touch of liquid white

or paint thinner.

the liquid white will make your color

a little brighter,

the paint thinner will
leave it the same color.

they both work very well,

make up your mind what you want to do.

if you want it to be a little brighter

then add the liquid white.

if you want it to stay the same color

paint thinner.

but very little, no matter what.

very little.

the secret to this painting technique

is to keep your oil paints
as firm and dry as possible.

that way you can continually
paint over the top of it

without them mixing together.

you don't want to become a mud mixer.

and if you've painted,

we've all mixed a little mud.

there we go.

see?

now think about, think about
little individual bushes

and stuff that live in here.

i'm gonna dip the brush
into a little touch

of the liquid white myself.

just to thin that down
so it sticks easier.

there we go.

think about shape and form.

don't just throw these in at random.

one at a time.

do the one that you think is farthest away

and work forward, forward, forward.

always working forward.

there we go.

one at a time.

one at a time.

i know you get tired of hearing that,

but it works for you.

and i want this, i want you
to enjoy success with this.

cuz if you enjoy success
you'll get hooked on it.

i enjoyed some success with this

many years ago.

and it has become my entire life

and i love it.

let's go into vandyke
brown and some dark sienna.

we'll just mix them together.

vandyke brown, dark sienna

bravery test time.

maybe in our world there lives

you ready for this?

there lives right here,

in one stroke,

let's put a nice tree trunk.

alright let's give him a friend.

yeah i know, i think everybody
should have a friend,

even a tree.

even an ol' tree.

a little titanium white,

this is a birch tree, i've decided.

touch, give it a little round-ward pull.

let me exaggerate. 

that way.

gotta make that little noise, too.

see there?

just make it look,

no pressure.

let the knife just barely, barely touch

so the paint breaks.

and by breaking i mean it leaves

all those little open holes in it.

there.

on the other side, a little
bit in the other direction.

like so.

there.

wherever you think they should be.

something like so,

we can go back to the dark sienna

and vandyke brown mixture,

add a little bit right in the middle,

and when this dries

and it dries,

it will feel like real birch bark.

it'll project off the canvas.

the paint's think, there's a lot of it.

it really, really jumps

right off there.

let's go back to our little liner brush.

get a little of that vandyke
brown, paint thinner.

the thinner's there
only to thin the paint,

make it very thin.

very thin.

and here and there let's
just put an indication

of a few little limbs and

little things that live out here.

this little tree needs some arms on him.

shoot, he's got to reach
out and talk to this guy.

there we go.

just a few.

just a few.

that works so well, i think it's time

to really get crazy.

let me put a little bush down here.

i want to cover up his foots.

down here at the base of this,

just wanna cover his foots up.

right now they're sort
of just hanging there.

but we'll make them come
right out of that little bush.

right there, right there.

i'm going back into my brown.

big bravery test.

right there.

right there.

maybe this is a different
kind of tree here,

just to break it up a little bit.

let's take some white,
a little dark sienna,

mix it together.

put a little vandyke in there, too,

what the heck.

take a little bit of paint and

all we're gonna do is just begin touching,

just touch,

something like so.

there we are.

just touch it.

touch it.

that's all. touch.

and as you work around

we're gonna let it get darker and darker

and darker and darker.

as it goes around the tree.

put a little brown with your color,

a little of that vandyke brown,

see it gets darker automatically.

once again when this is dry it will

actually feel like bark on a tree.

alright, wipe the knife off.

back to the paint thinner.

little bit of vandyke
brown with paint thinner.

just to thin it.

and let's put an arm on this tree.

maybe it lives in our
world right out in here.

boy, this would be a gorgeous
place for a tree to live.

gorgeous place for a tree to live.

maybe there's another arm right here.

it's up to you.

you decide how many arms are on your tree.

or how few.

maybe your tree died
last year, or sometime,

and it's just about

just about over.

make up little stories
when you're painting,

little stories just in your mind.

and then you actually project yourself

into that scene.

and when you do, this
becomes a reality sorta.

and you know, painters are expected to be

a little strange so,

that's alright if you stand
around and talk to yourself

about this scene and the
ol' guy that lived out here

or whatever,

that's alright if people
look at you a little strange.

painters are supposed to be that way.

maybe out in here there's just

a little ol' stick that lives.

use a little of the light color here.

wherever you think that should be.

it's up to you.

up to you.

i'll tell you what, maybe
there's an ol' limb.

right there.

something like that.

he's a tired old limb.

now you can take the knife

get that brush clean,

and you can scrape through this and

allow the black canvas to show through.

and it'll look like
little sticks and twigs

that live back in here.

i hope you can see those.

when you do your own
painting you'll see them,

they'll be there.

something about like so.

alright, that's all there is to it.

i think we're about ready to
take the contact paper off here

and see what we have.

this is the moment of truth.

so we just grab the paper

pull it right off.

and all of a sudden you have a painting

that's right there in that oval.

and it comes out so gorgeous,

and it just,

these painting's excite people.

i know none of us are
interested in those happy bucks

but if you're out selling paintings,

these are different.

you'll be surprised at
how people will come along

and they'll marvel at how you did this.

it's very very nice.

i think it's time to
sign this ol' painting.

and with that, we'll take a
little bit of the bright red.

signatures are as unique as painters.

each person will develop
their own signature.

so find your own signature.

i've had people that sign with initials,

with their whole name,

i've even known people who've signed

with a little symbol.

it's up to you.

but pick a signature and stick with it,

because it becomes your trademark.

and people a hundred
years from now will look

at your painting and recognize
exactly that it was you.

alright, let's go right in
here and just sign this one.

i have a very short
name, so it's quite easy.

we'll sign it, call it done.

there.

and i hope you enjoyed this one.

it's a very easy painting,

i'd love to see some photos of your work.

from all of us here, i'd like
to wish you happy painting

and god bless, my friend.





- hi, welcome back.

certainly glad you could join us today.

i thought today,

we'd do a different

little painting using some

of the liquid black

and liquid white.

so let's start out

and have 'em run all

the colors across the screen

that you need

to paint along with us.

while they'e doing that,

let me show you

what i got.

got my standard old,

pre-stretched, double prime canvas.

today, i've taken liquid black,

and put on the bottom.

and liquid white

put on the top,

it just blended in together.

so, the entire canvas is wet.

but it's dark on the bottom.

that's the only difference.

liquid black is just like liquid white,

only it has a black pigment in it.

and i use that a lot of times

when i know there's gonna be areas

that there's a lot of dark in.

the liquid black will make it

a lot easier for you.

let's start today with

a little bit of alizarin crimson.

just a small amount

on a little two-inch brush.

just a little.

let's go up in here.

i want to put a little pink

in the sky.

but i don't want much.

i just want enough

to warm it up some.

i don't want to set it on fire.

it's very easy to set it on fire.

just want to warm it up.

now, the crimson

is mixing with the liquid white.

it is a little liquid black there.

and automatically,

it will get lighter and lighter

in value.

that easy.

okay.

that's about all i want

of the crimson.

there.

now,

without cleaning the brush,

i'll go right into

some phthalo blue.

i like phthalo blue.

it's a beautiful, beautiful blue.

okay,

let's go up in here.

now, we start right at the top,

using our xs,

little cris-cross strokes,

go all the way across the top.

all the way across.

and then begin blending downward.

and be careful.

this blue is so much stronger

than the crimson.

it will eat up all the crimson

very quickly.

very quickly.

so let's just have it

about like that,

and then clean your brush.

and we'll take the clean brush,

and blend them both together.

just shake it off.

beat the devil out of it.

that really is the fun part

of this whole technique.

i have more pleasure

just beating the brush

than anybody in the country.

i have people now

that write me letters and say

they have no desire to paint.

they just bought a brush

so they can beat it

and take out their frustrations.

that's okay.

that's okay.

alright.

let's do...

let's put some mountains

in there today, shoot.

let's take some prussian blue,

some black,

alizarin crimson,

van dyke brown.

just mix 'em together.

mix 'em together.

make a nice dark, dark color.

put a little more crimson in it.

there.

okay.

now, the first thing we have to do

is decide where our mountain lives.

we'll cut off a little roll of paint.

there, you can see it.

let's go.

maybe there's a mountain,

lives right here.

now, the only thing we're concerned about,

is the nice, outside edge.

we could care less

what's going on

anywhere except the top.

right in there.

so, don't worry about it.

don't let a mountain scare you.

they're really one of

the neatest things to paint

in this technique.

and still probably the most popular

thing we paint.

alright,

i'm gonna take

two-inch brush,

grab it,

and pull.

because there's liquid white

and liquid black underneath,

the color will move.

it'll allow you to blend the color

right on the canvas.

and it also removes excess paint.

so, the next layer will

be much easier to apply.

and we'll just let it fade

right into that,

like that.

see there?

that's all there is to it.

let's take white,

white.

grab some midnight black

a little bit and put in there.

i want to grey this a little bit.

so, we put a little bit of,

maybe even a touch of bright red.

it's our world,

we can do anything

that we want here.

pull the paint out

as flat as you can get it.

once again,

our little roll of paint.

let's go up here.

now then,

just decide where the light's coming from.

and if you're right-handed,

you'll find it's usually easier

to have it coming from the right side.

left-handed,

try both ways.

left-handed people,

have been forced

to do right-handed things

their entire life.

so some left-handed people

will find it easier to
highlight on the right,

some on the left.

it's a very individual thing.

there we are.

little dooders in there.

now, i'm just gonna,

pull a little bit of that color

down to make the shadows.

i don't want distinct shadows in here.

just gonna pull

a little bit of it down.

maybe,

right over in here,

there's a little bump right there.

see there?

you decide.

you decide where all

these little things live.

there.

and you can just place

some darks and lights

back and forth,

to create all kinds of illusions.

there you go.

okay.

now,

as i say,

it's your world.

you decide where you want

all these little rascals to live.

okay,

we'll take a clean,

be sure its good and dry.

clean, dry two-inch brush.

if it's not dry,

it will dilute the paint,

and make it too soft.

so, be sure it's dry.

follow the basic angles
in these mountains,

and tap.

all we're doing is trying

to take out

the little tap marks

and blend everything together.

and then, lift upward.

see?

smooths it right out.

and it creates that illusion of mist,

right down at the base.

sometimes,

it's a little too straight for me.

i'm gonna,

put a little dooder right there.

see?

it's all you gotta a do.

you can change your mind.

and it just makes it

a little more interesting.

ready to get brave?

let's do it.

that little mountain went so well.



this really is your bravery test.

let's have a big mountain,

that lives right up here.

right up here.

maybe there's a little bump right there.

don't be afraid of these mountains, shoot.

once you make friends with

this knife,

they're one of the neatest
things you can make.

and you do need

to make friends with the knife.

it takes a little time.

takes a little time.

it's like anything else

when you do it at first.

it's a little foreign to you.

it takes a little while

to make friends with it.

alright.

very quickly,

with a little practice,

you'll be doing things

with a knife,

you just can't believe.

okay.

there.

here in the studio,

we just had a couple of

my young friends come in.

and,

they were only about,

one was six

and one was younger than that.

and they brought me some paintings

that they're doing.

it's unreal,

what young people can do with this too.

they were fantastic.

okay, now.

we're just gonna blend that,

just let it go right and all,

whew.

we said we was gonna make

a big mountain,

we weren't kidding.

once again,

our little roll of paint.

touch,

no pressure.

absolutely no pressure.

just let the paint glide

right along on there.

let it glide.

you want it to break.

in other words,

have all these holes in it.

that's what makes it look interesting.

there maybe is a little light zinging

right on there.

wherever,

it's up to you.

painting gives you freedom.

gives you creative freedom.

let's take some prussian blue

and some white,

a little black in it,

just to dull it down some.

there.

we'll make us a little

shadow color.

small roll of paint.

and once again,

just let it just glide

right along there,

like that.

maybe out here,

just a little highlight

right in there.

we just sort of let them come together.

just let your imagination take you

to any place that you want to go.

look up there.

see there?

just let it go.

just let it slide

right down though there.

no pressure.

i know you get tired of hearing that,

but it's so important,

and it's probably

the single biggest mistake

that people make,

is apply too much pressure.

no pressure.

i'm gonna put some

little bumps and stuff in here.

and we can do that.

put them anywhere that we want 'em.

there.

just a little.

maybe there's a little

dooder that lives over here.

mountains grow every which way.

just let 'em grow.

let 'em go,

wherever they want to be.

there.

just,

a few little things down in here.

take a little more of our shadow color.

there.

but that creates the illusion

of all kinds of little dooders.

and when you're at home

and have unlimited time,

shoot,

you can do

much better than this.

much, much better,

i know you can.

there we are.

wherever.

wherever.

okay.

something about like him.

now, let's get our brushes.

nice and dry.

and let's just blend this,

very gently.

just blend it.

we're tapping, following those angles.

notice the angles are coming down,

like that,

and we follow those angles.

we follow,

okay?

little bit of shadows,

right here behind

this little rascal.

don't want him left out.

then we can bring all

of that together.

lift upward.

takes out the tap marks,

brings everything together,

like that.

i'll tell you,

the best mountain painter

in this technique,

is probably my son, steve.

that rascal, whew.

he can paint some mountains.

maybe we'll get him on here

before the series is over.

he travels and teaches

all over the country.

but, if we can get

that little rascal in here,

we'll have him come to the show.

maybe i'll get him

to paint you a mountain,

because he can paint mountains.

course, i sound like a proud daddy

just keep yaking 'bout him.

and there's some truth to that.

there is some truth.

okay.

that'll give us a pretty good,

little mountain.

i'm gonna have time

to do some other things than this.

let's take

prussian blue,

phthalo green, black, brown.

oh, willing,

throw about any

old dark color in there.

i like to throw a little

of that phthalo green into it.

i'll make some evergreens.

it just gives them a nice,

nice color.

alright.

today, to make some evergreens.

let's grab us a...

we'll use a fan brush.

we'll use the old fan brush.

you could use a one-inch brush,

whatever,

it doesn't matter.

anything that works.

load both sides with a lot of paint.

let's go up in here.

and,

let's just tap in,

the basic indication

of some little evergreens,

that live far away back here.

they're far away.

they live right under the bottom

of this mountain.

it's one of the easiest ways

i've ever seen,

to create the illusion of

a lot of little trees, very simply.

very, very simply.

but now,

one of the things that happens a lot,

sometimes there's too much distance

between 'em,

and they begin looking like fence posts.

if that should happen,

all you need to do

is put a few more in there.

just fill up the area.

there.

because they're too far away,

you're not gonna see

a lot of detail.

things that are far away,

you see only basic shape,

form,

and basic color.

that's really about all.

maybe we'll have 'em

coming over here too.

and to create that illusion

of distance in your painting,

avoid having too much detail,

when things are supposed

to be far, far away.

yeah.

i know that sounds crazy,

don't put too much detail.

sometimes we can absolutely

put too much.

okay, here we are.

and we just sort of smash 'em down,

with the old fanbrush.

these fan brushes are marvelous.

they'll do wonderful, wonderful things,

where you paint an entire painting,

using nothing but the fan brush.

maybe we'll do that

in one of the shows sometime.

just to show you we can.

the big thing is time.

i'm gonna tap the base of that.

like so,

there we are.

now, we're gonna lift up.

it just smooths everything out.

blends it right into the painting.

there we are.

now we have a whole ridge

of just little trees

that live there.

okay,

we'll just use that same old brush.

it's got,

put some sap green in it.

and it has a little bit of that

pine tree color.

so when we touch yellow,

we're gonna get

beautiful, beautiful greens,

that'll end in yellow.

and then i'll touch a little

of the bright red.

bright red actually dulls the color.

i know it sounds crazy,

but red and green make brown.

so, when you put 'em together,

it dulls the color.

now then,

yeah.

and notice i didn't have to put

any dark color in there,

because we used the liquid black.

that's what it's great for.

i knew there was gonna be

a lot of dark in there.

didn't know exactly where,

but it doesn't much matter.

but i knew there was gonna

be a lot in there.

so,

let's just take,

and begin tapping in

the indication

of all kinds of little things

that are happening back here.

wherever.

there they are.

just little happy dooders.

i make up words.

i'm very bad about that.

i often wondered,

we have the shows playing

in numerous foreign countries now,

i often wonder how they translate,

"dooders."

there we are.

alright.

i like to go to mexico.

the show's been playing in mexico

for several years,

mexico city especially.

and, it's unbelievable,

some of the paintings

that our mexican instructors

are coming up with.

unbelievable.

because, they've adapted this to,

the scenery that they see in mexico.

and now,

we have a lot of instructors in japan,

and they're doing exactly

the same thing.

so, they're teaching me now.

that's nice,

when you can have

and get so lazy

and let somebody else do it,

and let them teach you.

here we are

see how that land flows downward?

i want it to look like

a little meadow back here,

where the land just flows,

just flows right down,

very soft.

there we are.

you make the decision

how far down it goes.

i tell you what,

i tell you what.

i'm sorry,

i get crazy.



when you paint like this

for any length of time,

you begin seeing things

in your painting.

when you see these things,

take advantage of 'em.

take advantage of 'em.

use 'em.

they're like gifts,

use 'em.

i want to,

yeah.

i'll just do it.

i just wanna put,

maybe do some more

evergreens here.

yeah,

i'll put a

whole line here.

there.

i need all these trees,

cuz my little squirrel needs

a place to hide.

tell you what,

i got another little piece of film here

i want to show you

about my little squirrel, peapod.

he is just the cutest little devil

you've ever seen.

now, how could you not

fall in love with someone like him?

isn't he precious?

thus is my little squirrel, peapod.

he lives with me.

well, actually he lives outside,

and he just,

cuz i've turned him loose

quite a while back.

he's full grown now.

he was just sort of a baby there.

but her still comes back,

everyday,

everyday.

and i feed him,

i'm soft-touched.

but, ain't he something?

i always have a lot of scratches

on my hands and stuff

and playing with him,

because they have very sharp claws.

the one thing i like to say

over and over,

we do not ever keep,

making these wild creatures pets.

i only raise 'em

and i turn 'em loose.

because wild creatures,

that's where they belong.

they should be wild.

if you want to keep a creature,

get a domestic animal.

doggy or a cat.

they're a lot of fun.

they're a lot of company.

but, wild creatures are to be wild.

that's the way god intended it to be.

there we are.

but sometimes they need

a little help.

and if they do,

i jump right in there.

i like to play with them.

like to watch them grow.

but these little squirrels,

when i get 'em,

a lot of times they're so small,

that their eyes aren't even open.

and then you have

to get up at night,

just like,

well, like i did with steve

when he was a tiny, little baby.

and you have to feed him

two or three times every night.

of course, steve's not so tiny anymore.

he's over 6''5,

almost 6''6.

must have fed him good.

yeah.

that rascal,

certainly grew.

he out grew me.

we'll take a little bit of white.

i wanna create the illusion

of a little mist down here

at the base of these.

i'll show you why,

just to set it.

and i'll put some that's more distinct,

in this little misty area here,

this little misty area,

will turn out to be

your best friend,

because this will be your separator.

and you could just bang

it in any old way,

and then we'll just

tap it till it blends together.

makes the base of the trees

look very soft and gentle.

there.

and most of this will disappear.

but here and there

and there and here,

we want to put a more distinct tree,

a bigger tree.

we'll put a little more paint on here.

get all that phthalo green there.

oh, i like it.

brown and crimson.

i'll put some sap in there too,

i didn't have much phthalo.

and i want to have

a green tint to it.

okay.

let's see what we got here.

maybe,

you know, bobby.

gotta have a big tree in here somewhere.

gotta have a big old tree.

here it comes.

there we are.

we'll put some highlights

on there and separate it.

that'll separate it right apart.

let's give him a friend.

there we go.

right there.

i know it's hard to see right now,

but, we'll separate it.

we'll separate it.

maybe here and there

we can put the indication

of a few more,

a little closer to us,

a little bigger,

a little more detail.

and then that

little misty area will separate 'em.

we'll just put a few in here.

you decide in your world

how many there are.

there we go.

something like that.

i need one down here.

just right there.

okay.

now,

without doing anything

to that brush except

going through yellow,

because it has blue and black in it,

you'll make a beautiful green color.

that'll give us the highlight.

okay?

let's go back up here.

same old brush.

there we are.

now, we can put in

a few little highlights.

don't kill all your dark color.

i know it's tempting.

a little yellow ochre,

indian yellow just mixed in there,

change of flavor.

but don't kill all the dark.

evergreens are normally

pretty dark trees.

leave 'em that way.

there.

a little over in here.

i'm just bopping around here

trying to get these put in

as quick as i can.

i'll put a few more little things

in this painting,

it's a lot of fun.

this liquid black, try it.

try it.

i think you'll find it
does wonderful things.

now then,

maybe,

yeah, why not?

let's start.

we'll put in some little grassy areas

and there.

little yellow.

i'm gonna dip the brush

into at least a little
touch of paint thinner.

just enough to thin the paint

a tiny bit.

we're getting quite

a buildup of paint on here.

so we need

to paint this a little thinner.

see it there?

look at all the layers in this painting.

i mean,

it just goes on and on and on.

and you can do it so simple.

there we are.

okay,

and maybe a little touch

of the bright red here and there.

i like it.

i like it with red in there,

it does nice things.

okay.

we need a little path in there.

let me take a little dark sienna,

van dyke brown.

gotta have a way to get in there.

we'll just put us a little path

right in there.

mostly dark sienna.

put a little of the van dyke,

and we'll let it wander right

on out through there.

little brown, little white.

just enough to put the indication

of a little highlight on there.

there, see?

it's that easy.

just like you're putting snow

on the mountain.

maybe,

i know.



let's take a little black.

maybe come right up in here.

maybe there's just a little stone

that is right there.

happy little stone.

we put in dark first.

and we come back with some brown,

white, a little black in it.

and let's put a little highlight on that,

just enough to make it interesting.

just enough, see?

pull a little but of it down,

not much, not much.

alright.

then, some little grassy areas

right around his foot.

bring the path all into the painting.

there.

alright.

got just a minute left here.

tell you what,

i'll need a tree in here.

i need a little tree.

my producer right now

is gonna kill me for doing this.

right there is a little tree.

and we'll take,

a little light color,

just tap the side here

give it some highlight.

grab a liner brush,

put a couple little tree branches on it.

this old tree is dead.

this old tree had a bad day.

old evergreen tree,

you just need some little

limbs hanging out through there.

wherever.

not many left,

just a few.

see?

but that's really all there is to it.

hope you've enjoyed this little painting.

it's something different.

shows you how to use the liquid black,

and i believe it'll bring you

fantastic results.

from all of us here,

i'd like to wish you happy painting,

and god bless, my friend.





- hello, i'm bob ross, and
i'd like to welcome you

to the 20th joy of painting series.

son of a gun, it's hard for me to believe

this is the 20th series,
but it is, and i'd like

to thank you very much
for inviting me back

for another series of painting shows.

if this is your first time with us,

let me extend a personal
invitation for you

to drag out your brushes and your paints

and paint along with us each show.

i think you'll enjoy it.

tell you what, let's start out today

and have 'em run all the colors

across the screen that you
need to paint along with me.

and i think we'll just do a
happy little picture today.

so, let me tell you what
i've got done up here.

we have our standard old

but you use whatever size you want.

and we have it covered with
a little bit of liquid white,

just a thin, even coat, just
enough to make the canvas wet.

and with that, we'll just take off,

and we'll have a super time.

start today, i think we'll
use a little one-inch brush

and we'll go into a
very, very small amount

of the phthalo blue.

just a little bit.

don't want much.

and let's make some, let's make

some happy little clouds in our world.

let's come right up here.

and, we'll just take this brush,

and we'll just bounce in some nice shapes.

now, when we're doing
this, we're interested

in the white area, not the dark.

so don't worry about the dark area.

we're gonna blend that all out.

all we're doing is putting in some color

for the shadows of our clouds.

and this is one of the
nicest, easiest ways

of making very effective,
great big ol' clouds.

there.

see, we're interested in
this white area, once again.

maybe there's another little cloud

that lives in our world,
right along there.

wherever you think they should be,

then that's exactly where they should be.

just wherever.

and just use the old
little one-inch brush,

and just, i'm making tiny little circles.

just tiny little circles.

there we are.

okay, maybe i'll add a little
color right in here too.

just so there'll be a little color

at the base of this cloud.

there.

now then,

let's take our little brush,

this is a two-inch brush,
and go right up in here,

and very gently, i'm using
just the corner of the brush.

we'll make little, round
circle patterns here,

just sort of wind it
up, blend it together.

allow it to blend with the white

that's already on the canvas.

and that's the joy of this
wet-on-wet painting technique.

the fact that it's wet
allows you to blend color,

right on the canvas.

right on the canvas.

there you go.

now, it's beginning to
make a little sense.

see how those dark areas end
up being the nice shadows

and the white areas will
end up being our clouds.

this is a great way to make
clouds for seascape paintings.

just great, big, fluffy clouds.

works very nice.

there we are.

now then, while we have
this old brush dirty,

tell you what let's do.

let's go back into a little
bit more of that phthalo blue.

phthalo blue is a very nice color,

it's a very warm blue.

i like that.

just a little color on the brush.

okay, let's go back up here.

let's have some water in this painting.

if you've painted with me before,

you know i'm a fanatic for water.

i love water.

and it's one of the nicest,
easiest things to paint

in this technique.

and today, maybe this
one will be still water.

so we want these lines to be
basically straight across here.

cause as you know, still water
is always flat, always level.

there.

now, just very lightly,
go all the way across,

and sort of bring it together.

and that light area here,
it'll remain in there.

there.

okay.

now, the most fun part

of this whole technique
is washing the brush.

so let's do that.

we wash our brushes with odorless thinner.

shake off the excess.

 and just beat
the devil out of it.

this is where you take
our all your frustrations

and hostilities and just have a good time.

let's go into a little titanium white.

we'll use the old fan brush.

we'll make some little clouds.

i'll be right back, let me
grab the least little touch

of the bright red.

just enough, a little bit more.

there.

just enough to put a little pinkish glow

into our little clouds.

don't want much, don't want much.

okay, let's go up here.

now we gotta make big decisions.

we'll just use this brush and decide

where our little clouds live.

and, we just come along here
and sort of drop 'em in.

this also works very well
with a little one-inch brush.

very well.

either way that you wanna do it.

either way.

if you haven't painted with us before,

one of the things that we try to do here,

we try not to teach you just to copy.

all we're trying to do
is teach you a technique

and turn you loose on the world.

we use no patterns, no tracings.

all we do is sort of
have an idea in our mind,

and we just sorta let it happen.

and if you'll practice this a little bit,

very soon you can enjoy the freedom

of creating a painting
right on the canvas.

right on the canvas.

and to me, that's where
it really becomes fun.

it's when you can
literally create a painting

right on the canvas as
you're working on it.

you look at what you're
doing, and you'll see things.

they'll just sort of happen.

and you learn to take
advantage of whatever happens

and use it to make your painting special.

and you can do that.

okay, let's go back,


get our old two-inch
brush, and i just wanna now

blend all that together.

just blend together.

i'm being careful not to
touch these top edges yet.

i'm just blending the blue and the white

down here together, very gently,

still using little circular strokes.

there we go.

just sort of let that mix together.

i'm getting very close to the top,

but i'm trying not to
touch it at this point.

very close, but not touching.

there.

a little bit up in here.

see?

just sorta blend it together.

mix it up, just like you're
making a cake or something.

just mix it up.

a little bit in here, right there.

okay.

good.

but this is a beautiful way. 

i just beat the brush like
that to knock off excess paint.

it's a beautiful way to
create a very effective,

big, fluffy clouds.

now we're just sorta lifting it up.

this will blend it all
together, smooth it out.

there.

see there?

and then, very lightly,
two hairs and some air,

just gently, gently, gently
blend the entire sky.

and with that,

shoot, we have a pretty
nice looking little sky.

and there wasn't anything to it.

now then, let's get crazy.

let's take, we'll use some midnight black,

little prussian blue.

now, prussian blue is much
darker than phthalo blue,

it's strong, whew.

very strong color.

we'll put some van dyke brown,

a little alizarin crimson in there too.

but we're looking for a very dark color,

it should look black.

pull it out as flat as you can get it,

and go straight down with the knife,

and we'll just cut off
a little roll of paint.

there it is.

it's right out at the edge of the knife.

let's go up here.

now, i want to make some
tiny little mountains

up in here, that are far away.

i don't want these to be very big,

because we wanna create the
illusion of distance here.

using a very firm pressure,
just literally push this

right into the fabric.

and i don't want a lot of mountains today,

that's about all we need.

with a two-inch brush, i'm
gonna grab this and pull it.

just pull it.

it does two things, removes excess paint

and it blends all this together.

there we go.

now, when we're painting
mountains, as you know,

you always want the top of the mountain

to be more distinct than
the bottom of the mountain.

because at the bottom, we have mist

and now we have wonderful pollution,

and we have all these things that break up

and diffuse light, and
it creates this softness

at the base of the mountain.

let's go into a little titanium white,

what the heck.

very small amount.

get a very, very small
amount of paint on the knife.

now then,

barely touch, no pressure.

no pressure.

and i don't want this to be very distinct.

i want this to be very quiet,

subdued, far away,

gentle, soft.

think about those types of words and stuff

when you're painting, and it'll help

your hand go much more gentle.

but very soft.

don't want a lot of detail in this.

and we'll take a little
bit of blue and white,

and just the indication of some shadows,

don't even want a lot of shadow back here.

too much detail will ruin
that illusion of distance.

just enough, just enough

to give the feeling that
there's a nice mountain

living back in there.

now with a clean, dry
brush, following the angles,

always follow the angles,

we're gonna very gently,

very gently tap it and
then lift it upward.

and that'll help also
create that illusion of mist

at the base of the mountain.

shoot, let's get crazy.

find another one-inch brush.

or you could use your fan brush, whatever.

take a little bit more
of the titanium white.

maybe in our world, maybe
this old cloud right here,

it just sort of drift right
down in front of the mountain.

so, just a little white.

little circles, tiny little circles.

shoot, maybe there's one right here.

i don't know.

i don't know, just sorta
look at your painting

and make a decision.

maybe it just sorta wraps
this old mountain up.

we'll take a two-inch brush
and just blend it together.

this is a super way of making mountains,

that look like their just
laying out here in the mist.

i lived in alaska for many, many years,

and you see some of the most
beautiful scenery there.

god was having a good
day when he made alaska.

beautiful.

beautiful.

there, see that old mountain just lays

up here in the mist
now, and floats around,

has a good time all day.

now then.

maybe we'll have some
little foothills back here.

i like to do little foothills.

and we'll take some of
that same mountain color,

add the least little
touch of sap green to it.

little sap green, there we are.

but it's predominantly blue.

the one that's farthest away here,

we'll make predominantly blue.

okay, let me wipe my knife off.

and let's use, we'll use a
one-inch brush, what the heck.

you could use your fan
brush or two-inch brush,

it doesn't matter.

load a little color in there.

and let's go right up in here.

now, we have to make a big decision.

where does our little foothills live.

maybe we'll have one
coming right over here.

we'll start this one out back here,

just using the corner of the brush

and pulling straight down, gently.

maybe a little foothill
comes right over like that.

wherever.

once again, this is a
very individual thing,

painting is.

so,

just sorta look at it
and make up your mind

how you want your painting to be.

now then, when you're doing the foothills,

especially layers of foothills,

you want a little misty area in between,

that's your separator.

so take the brush, two-inch brush,

and just tap the base of it.

and you can tap quite firmly.

you can probably hear how hard
i'm hitting the canvas here.

and then, very lightly, just
lift it upward a little bit.

there.

okay, now then, maybe we'll
have several layers in here.

when you're doing landscapes, each layer,

each plane, as it comes closer to you,

should get darker in value.

so we'll use that same
color, and i'll just add

a little bit of that mountain color.

see, it's right here, i'll just add

a little of that into it.

that'll make it a little darker.

maybe a touch more of the green.

there we go.

okay.

now, maybe over here, we'll
hold the brush up like this.

and that'll make tops
that are a little taller,

a little more distinct,

cause they're getting
a little closer to you.

there.

but you can create just layer after layer

after layer like this.

and it enhances your painting tremendously

because it creates that illusion of depth.

back to our two-inch brush,

and once again,

once again, we wanna create that mist.

see how that mist in between separates?

it's your best friend.

take care of it.

take care of it.

there we go.

now lift upward.

and maybe,

i'll tell you what,

let's have one more.

let's have one more.

i'm adding a little
more of that dark color

right into that same original pile.

one more.

and then, maybe it lives right here.

but it's darker in value.

it's a little darker.

there we go.

and we'll let him come,
maybe, right down in here.

i don't know.

there.

but each layer, each layer
needs to get darker in value.

to keep that feeling of
distance in the painting.

and i know i repeat that over and over,

but it's so important.

so important.

you don't want just a flat old painting.

shoot.

we want a masterpiece here.

and you can do that.

once again, we're gonna tap that base,

just like so.

very lightly, lift it upward.

there.

and maybe, we're
beginning to get down here

to where there are a few reflections,

so we'll take a little
paint on the two-inch brush,

grab it and pull it straight down.

it's most important that these reflections

come straight down.

most important.

if you go at an angle like
this, it won't look right.

see, even there, it doesn't look right.

now very lightly, go across.

very, very lightly.

just enough to blend it and
give it the feeling of water.

it's one of the nicest
things about this technique,

it's instant reflections. 

now then, we'll take a
little of the liquid white,

put the least little touch
of the bright red in it.

just, least little touch.

just enough to flavor it a little bit.

be careful, because very quickly,

this can get really intense in color.

now we just cut across.

that's all there is to it.

go up here,

and we'll just put in, just the indication

of a happy little
waterline that lives here.

now, if you get one that's maybe

a little too strong or too bright,

just go back and rub it.

the more you rub it,
the lighter it'll get,

because it'll just be absorbed

right into the color that's underneath.

no big deal.

and if you've painted with me before,

you know without question

that we don't make mistakes here.

we just have happy accidents.

but you learn to use
anything that happens.

okay, maybe, right there.

and, little ripples.

but notice how all these
lines are basically straight.

if they're not, it's gonna look

like your water's gonna run
right outta your painting

and get your floor wet, and you'll have

to tie a bucket on one side. 

we don't want you to have to do that.

now,

tell you what.

clean off a little spot.

let's take some black, prussian blue,

brown, crimson, sap green,
all those same colors,

but with no white in it.

so very, very dark.

very dark.

looks black on the palette.

there.

okay, let me clean my knife.

and i just wipe the knife
on an old paper towel.

find a fan brush here.

let's take the fan brush,
and go right into that color.

load a lot of paint onto the brush.

both sides.

see, the bristles are, there's
a lot of paint in there.

okay, let's go up here.

maybe back in here, in
our world, there lives,

well there does now, anyway,

there lives a happy little evergreen tree.

and we just use the corner of the brush.

just the corner,

and as you work down the tree,
add more and more pressure

so that the bristles bend downward

much, much more.

look at there.

isn't that a nice way to make
a happy little evergreen?

let's give him a friend.

you know me.

i think everybody, everybody
should have a friend.

friends are so important.

there.

alright.

maybe, shoot.

in our world, maybe
there's three trees here.

you can put as many or as few as you want.

the only thing that we
would like to teach you here

is how to make a tree.

you decide how many trees
you have in your world.

maybe we'll have some,

maybe there's a little
reflection down here.

just put some general shapes,

we're not looking for detail.

not looking for detail.

just very basic little shapes.

shoot, who knows?

maybe there's some land there too.

you can just push up with the fan brush,

a little bit down for the reflection.

and let's take, we'll use
the old two-inch brush,

and grab this, decide
where water and land meet,

and pull straight down once again.

straight down.

son of a gun.

instant reflections.

go across,

and that easy.

that easy.

and see, these reflections,
you can push 'em.

see how you can push 'em?

because the canvas is
wet, you can do that.

you can do anything here.

oh this canvas, you have
total and absolute power.

unlimited power here.

 when i go home,
the only thing i can do

is take the garbage out.

but here, i can do
anything that i wanna do.

let's take a little of the
dark sienna and a little white,

get a little roll of paint on the knife,

and let's put a little
indication here and there

of a little tree trunk
that lives in these.

there.

don't want a great deal.

don't want a great deal, just enough to

just enough to indicate
there's something in there.

and you can just take
the point of the knife,

and just scrape through and
make little lines and sticks

and all those little things.

tell you what, let me
grab another fan brush.

i have several of them going here.

and let's take and go
into a little yellow,

this is cad yellow,

a little touch of that color
we made the tree out of,

since it has blue in it, as
soon as we touch the yellow,

turns beautiful green color.

maybe a little yellow ochre too.

i want a dark green here.

once again, load the bristles quite full.

a lot of color.

let's go up here.

now then,

let's put some highlights
on these little trees.

don't wanna overdo.

if you put too much highlights on here,

too many highlights, then it

loses it's effectiveness.

we want these to be quite dark.

look at there.

and that's all there is to it.

darker, darker, darker.

now, maybe down here, there's

some little grassy
things that grow on this.

and you can just make those

by pushing up with the brush, that's all.

very easy.

now.

let's have some land under there.

we need something to hold those trees up

so they don't fall over in the water

and make a big splash.

there.

little van dyke brown, little
dark sienna mixed together.

like so, we'll take a little
touch of that brown and white.

just make the indication
of a little land there.

little bit of the liquid
white that we had left over.

and we'll just put in a little waterline.

this waterline is your separator.

it's a light between two darks,

and that separates it, and makes it,

makes it stand out.

alright.

tell you what, we'll
just use this big brush.

ready to have some fun?

if you've painted with me before,

you know that i love to make big trees.

so let's do that.

i'll use the old two-inch brush today.

the old two-inch brush.

so often we avoid this
brush because it's big

and we're afraid of it.

a lot of paint.

wiggle.

wiggle, wiggle,

then sharpen it, just
like you would a knife.

look how sharp this brush is.

there, you can see.

it's very sharp.

let's go up here.

now then, maybe in our world
lives a big evergreen tree.

right there.

just touch the canvas.

now, we use just the corner.

just the corner of the brush.

and just go back and forth,

and begin laying in

all of these beautiful
little limbs and stuff

that live here on this tree.

there.

okay.

tell you what,

we'll have another one.

you knew that, didn't you?

you knew i'd have a friend out here.

there.

okay.

now then,

let's have some, maybe
there's some big, leafy trees,

not evergreens that live here.

there.

let's just push in some,

push in some nice leaf and branch shapes.

look at there.

and when you use a big brush,
you can do this very rapidly.

now, let's go on the other side.

we need some over here too.

now, you can do this with a
one-inch brush if you wanted to.

works just as well.

just as well.

this is just a little bit faster.

a little bit faster.

there we are.

okay.

just bring it right on
down, right on down.

now you have to start
making big decisions.

okay, we'll just put it there.

a nice bush lives there.

tell you what, let's get crazy.

maybe.

maybe it just goes all the way across.

in your world, you can do
anything that you want.

if you want this shrubbery
and bushes and trees

to come all the way across, then do it.

do it.

alright.

now then, we can just take a clean knife,

and just make the indication
of little sticks and twigs,

just by scraping, just
the point of the knife.

we're gonna cover most of those up,

but some of 'em will show.

we can even use a little brown and white,

come right up in here,

put the indication of a trunk.

not a great deal of detail, just a little.

little over here.

cause these are gonna be
deep in the old tree here,

you're not gonna see much of them.

but they're there.

now then, let's take,

we'll dip the brush into a
little of the liquid white.

one-inch brush.

we'll go right through,

i'll use a little cad yellow,
grab some sap green up here.

there we are.

cad yellow, sap green, pull
the brush in one direction,

load a lot of color in it.

okay, let's go up here.

now then, think about all your
little leaves and stuff here

that would just shine and,

oh, they would sparkle out here in the sun

under this big mountain.

and when you're painting,
make up little stories.

think about the scene
that you're painting,

become part of it.

make friends with a tree.

shoot, you can just
drop all this stuff in.

and let it go.

darker, darker, darker as you work down

toward the base of the tree, though,

darker, darker.

add a little yellow ochre here or there,

a little indian yellow sometimes, just

just to change the flavor.

wherever you want 'em.

there we are.

little touch of bright
red even, here and there.

it's up to you.

up to you.

there.

and you choose even the time of year.

let's go on this other big tree over here.

maybe over here, there lives,

there lives this big tree.

think about individual shapes and form

inside of this tree.

don't just throw it on at random.

think about, think about
the limbs inside the tree

that give it shape and form.

there.

okay.

darker, darker, darker,

down here toward the base.

much darker.

let's have a bush right here
that has red flowers on it.

look at that.

see there?

just by putting a little bit
of red on the end of the brush,

you can do that.

here lives another one.

just do one bush at a time, though.

one at a time.

there they go.

okay.

just wherever you want 'em.

shoot.

it's coming along pretty nice.

there.

okay.

and the other side, over here,

we'll put in some little bushes here.

and you can use the brush sidewards.

just push upward and create
all kinds of little things.

just like so.

alright.

i'm gonna put a little path in here,

use a little van dyke brown,
we got just a second left,

so i'll throw that in.

a little brown and white.

give this indication of a little path.

then all we need to do
is put a little bush

over the top of it, and
it sets it right down

into the painting.

shoot, i think we have
a finished painting.

with that, i'm gonna
wish you happy painting,

and god bless, my friend,
i'll see you next show.



- welcome back.

today i thought we'd do a
painting that's right out of the

heart of alaska.

we're gonna start with a black
canvas, which i've already

covered with a coat of van
dyke brown and prussian blue.

and these colors are transparent,
so it'll still look black.

in this painting we want
to show the moon in the sky

with some happy little
clouds floating around,

put some almighty mountains,
some beautiful, frost-colored

bushes, and we'll see
what happens from there.

- i'm gonna start with
a little titanium white.

and we'll start right up here
where we want the moon to be.

and just make little x-es.

and just start working around.

you want to start in the center
and work outwards so that

the light gets progressively
darker as it moves away

from the moon.

and we'll go out in this
direction so that it hits the

curvature of the earth
and bounces back up.

okay, there we go.

already, you should be able
to see how the white paint is

beginning to pick up the color underneath.

and we'll just blend this together.

there we go.

okay, now we don't want to
let this get too bright;

we still want it to look like
night when we're finished,

so just work it 'round and
around and all the way out

to the edges.

and we'll do a little over in here.

now then, we'll take the
large brush, and very gently,

we'll bring this together, just
by making little x patterns.

there we go.

makes all the little actions in the sky.

and we'll come across.

now, let's put the moon in.

and we'll do that by taking a
clean brush, and we'll load it

full of white paint,
and we go right straight

into the canvas where
we want the moon to be,

and we push quite hard.

and push the paint right into
the canvas, and just turn it.

there.

get it in with the knife,
very carefully, we'll take off

just the excess paint.

let me clean this ol' big brush out here.

there we go.

now very gently, we'll
bring this together.

just work it back and forth,
and create the illusion of a

moon setting up here in the sky.

okay.

now then, let's put some
happy little clouds up here.

and we'll use the almighty
fan brush, and we'll just use

this blue and brown color.

and...

load it full of paint, and
we'll take, just using the

corner, and we'll put in
some happy little clouds,

just let one float right
across the moon, here.

lot of paint on the brush.

okay.

there we go.

now, maybe, maybe, maybe,
you can see right up here,

we'll put another happy little cloud.

little sneaky cloud running
around here at night.

there we go.

and you're pushing this paint
into the canvas; really,

really work it into the canvas.

and maybe down here we've got
some little delicate clouds

that are just floating around,
really small, little clouds.

there we go.

just lay 'em in.

mmmkay.

now, let us clean the fan brush.

and wiping dry.

and we'll take a little
bit of titanium white,

mixed with just a little
bit of the same color.

and we'll push some highlights in here.

just take the fan brush
and just work the corners.

just the corner of the brush.

just push the paint right in here.

there.

a little light playing
across the top of this cloud.

maybe right along here.

this is your world, so wherever
you want light to strike

this cloud, let it happen.

okay, and let's put some
highlights right along these

little clouds right here.

and we're pushing quite hard with this.

once again, we want to push
the color right into the

material if possible.

there we go.

now, in this cloud up here,
since it's above the moon,

the light's gonna strike the bottom of it.

so we put the highlights
on the bottom rather than

on the top.

there.

give me a nice little thing right out

through here like that.

maybe a little light striking
around up in here, just a

little something playing.

okay, now, we'll take the big brush.

make sure it's dry and clean.

and we're just gonna
gently hypnotize this.

just to bring it together.

isn't that fantastic?

look at that.

look at all the little things
that happen in this cloud.

this is unplanned.

it really just happens.

you really can't control
what's gonna happen here.

don't try to, don't fight it.

use what happens.

okay.

let's make a happy little mountain now.

we'll take some blue and some
brown, still using the same

color.

and we'll draw in our
basic mountain shape, here.

here we go.

really push.

really forcing that
paint into the material.

maybe we'll make this one come
up a little higher so we can

see clouds behind it.

we use a large brush to pull
that paint down, this removes

any excess that we have
left on the canvas.

'cause we're trying to get
all the paint off the canvas

that we possibly can.

okay.

let's just clean the brush.

once again, we clean the brush
with odorless paint thinner.

now, let's put some snow on the mountain.

we'll take some titanium
white and just a little touch

of blue.

just a little blue.

okay.

and let's let some snow just
run right down this mountain.

just let it break and play.

this has a very delicate touch.

very light touch.

you're almost touching
the canvas with the knife.

oh, here's a nice little ridge,
just let this little ridge

just play around like that.

and there we go.

and we'll put a little
bit of light right on

this little peak.

let it just break and play.

now we're gonna use blue and
white next to a darker value

for the shadow and we'll start
right here and let this just

follow right along.

let it go.

okay.

and we'll put a little
shadow behind this one.

there we go.

maybe all the way over
here a little shadow.

each highlight needs
its own private shadow.

and we can bring this
down a little further.

as you work on these mountains,
you begin seeing all kinds

of little things happening.

use what you see.

don't plan it.

and maybe we'll put a
little ridge right here.

ah, there's another one,
i see him right there.

there he is.

okay, now let's lay the bottom
of these mountains into a

little mist.

clean, dry brush, and all
we're gonna do is tap.

always following the angles
we've created in the mountain,

down like so.

just tap.

mmmkay, over here, we'll follow
these angles, and tap from

this direction.

okay, a little bit here.

then we're gonna lift upward
just enough to take out the

little tap marks.

there we go.

mmmkay, now we're getting
a nice little misty effect

over here.

and we just work that right
out, and we're ready to come

forward.

we've created small mighty
mountains in just a few minutes

here.

mmmkay.

now, we'll take a little
more of the blue and brown,

and back to one of our golden rules,

you need dark in order to show light,

so we're gonna start by
putting some dark on here.

load a lot of paint into the
brush, and we just push in

little bushes right out of the...

right out of the brush.

here he comes.

there he is.

just put in some dark on him so we'll have

some light showing.

alright.

okay, now we can take a brush...

we use a little bit of magic
white and a little bit of

plain white.

thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

so we're thinning the
paint just a little bit.

and we're gonna push in beautiful
little snow-covered trees,

way back in the distance on here.

there.

look at those son of a guns.

there they are.

just hundreds of little trees,
little bushes, all these

things happening way back there.

okay.

now we'll take the big brush
and clean it up a little bit.

and we have all these nice
bushes here, they need some

reflections.

so we'll take a clean brush
and just a little bit of white

paint on it, and we'll pull that down.

just grab ahold and pull.

make these nice streaks.

this is mixing with the color
that we have underneath,

the blue and the brown.

these lines need to be
straight down reflections.

what a fantastic way to make reflections.

there.

now, we'll go across just enough
to give it a watery effect;

we don't want to destroy all those lines.

we just want to make it
look like it's in the water.

mmmkay.

let's take...

lay a little touch of snow along there.

we'll just take the knife
with a little paint.

just put some little
snow right along there.

ooh, better get your coat
out, this is gonna be a cold

painting.

i may have to go find my
old mukluks and put 'em on.

in alaska, we have a word for
people who have came to the

great country and only been
there a short period of time:

it is called "cheechako."

and if you've been in alaska
less than a year, you're a

cheechako.

so maybe you've learned a new word today.

and where i live it's not
unusual for it to get 60, 70

degrees below zero.

and we have a thing in nature
that happens, it's called

ice fog.

normally, it has to be
about 30 below or colder.

and this ice fog coats
everything, every little branch,

with little crystals of ice
that weigh almost nothing.

but they create unbelievable beauty.

light plays though these little
crystals and acts as little

prisms and breaks up the light.

you see all the fantastic
colors shining and shimmering

and it is really something.

okay, here i'm just scratching
right through the paint.

make it look like little trunks.

alrighty, let's take the
almighty fan brush...

during this series we have made
trees with a two and a half

inch brush, with a one inch
brush, and a fan brush.

so, all of these brushes you
can use to create almighty

trees.

today we're gonna try the fan brush.

load a lot of paint into the brush.

figure out where you'd like to
have a beautiful little tree.

just touch, and then just
using the corner of the brush,

just begin building some
little limbs on here.

there we go.

and we're still using
the blue and the brown.

come right down there.

that looks like a good place for a tree.

gonna push the paint
right into the canvas.

okay, and maybe we need one
over here that's sort of tired,

sort of leaning over a little bit.

in nature, trees grow in every direction.

maybe we'll put another one right here.

these trees are so much fun to
get started on, i have a hard

time stopping.

and we'll put another one right there.

now, as we work forward, we
want these trees to begin

getting much larger to show
distance in this painting.

in so many of the techniques
where people paint very

rapidly, the paintings are
very flat, very overworked,

washed-out looking.

in this technique, you
can create depth that is

unbelievable.

distance in paintings.

and this is how we do it.

we use size, we use color.

all of these things combine
together to create the illusion

of distance in a painting.

alrighty.

well, let's do some more trees.

we'll put some on the
other side over here.

put an almighty tree up here.

there he is.

very dark.

mmmkay.

just let that tree come
right out of your fan brush.

trees live in your fan brush, but you have

to scare them out.

it takes a little practice.

the first time, it's
gonna be a little touchy.

next time, it gets easier.

each time you do it, you learn from it.

you progress.

i've painted for 20 years,
and i'm still learning.

every day i learn.

spend time studying nature
if you wish to paint nature.

you must understand nature.

talk to trees, look at the birds.

whatever it takes.

okay.

now, then, let's do an
almighty tree, big tree.

we'll come right over in here.

okay, here he comes.

big ol' tree.

you got your coat out yet?

you may need it here any second.

in the paintings like this, on
the black canvas, you can do

a multitude of things
with this, multitude.

you can use all different colors.

all you're looking for is
a color that's transparent,

so that the black shows through.

use this black to your advantage.

we'll have another tree right there.

there we go.

there are a lot of people we
have taught to do these black

canvas who are absolutely
making a living out of it now.

and we have literally taught
thousands and thousands

of people to be almighty painters.

to create things of beauty
they never dreamed possible.

and you can do it too.

you can do it.

just jump right in here and
paint along with us, we'll

teach you how to do it;
we'll make a happy painter

out of you also.

okay, i think that's
enough trees for right now.

let's take a little bit of
white and blue mixed together,

looking for a dark blue, here.

and let's go right into this
area here, and let's put some,

let's put some happy little
bushes and trees back in here.

all this is is the shadow color.

we put the shadow in first,
and then we'll highlight it.

and, while we've got the shadow
here, let's put some right

into the water.

we can just reflect some
of this right in here.

okay, now, let's...

oh, let's have some bushes
over in this side also.

just start bringing
this painting together.

now at home you have unlimited time.

you can sit and come up with
all kinds of fantastic things

to do in this.

you can put tremendous detail.

here we are limited on time,
so we're trying to give you

ideas, we're not trying to just
give you something to copy,

we're trying to give you an
idea, to teach you a technique,

so that you can use this and
make unbelievable things.

back into the magic white
and the titanium white.

and we'll make some
happy little bushes here.

look how that color stands
out against the black.

there we go.

and as you work more and more
in this, you'll know just by

pulling the brush through,
the correct consistency of the

paint, if it's too
thin, if it's too thick.

it's only a matter of time
where you can pull the brush

through that paint and
almost tell what brand it is.

now we'll just come across,
and we'll turn this into

beautiful little reflections.

and while we've got the brush
loaded here, we'll just, let's

do this one right here.

big tree here.

there we go.

little more of the magic white.

and we'll come right down here
and put a happy little bush.

now, let's reflect these right
into the water; just let 'em

reflect.

okay.

clean off the brush.

that's the most fun of
painting is beating your brush.

it's a good way to get rid
of all your anxieties and

hostilities.

look at those reflections.

but it's a very gentle touch.

and now we'll take a
little bit of white paint,

just put some snow in
here for all these things

to sit on.

there we go.

okay, a little bit of dark
paint; we'll put some trunks in.

some stems.

there we are.

this sort of gives the
tree body, gives it shape.

and it also shows distance in a painting.

use these to your advantage.

okay.

take a little magic white, make
us a water line under here.

just use a thin paint
to make your water line.

it'll flow off the knife.

alrighty.

there we go.

nice little water line.

mmmkay, let's put some happy
little bushes over here on the

other side now.

and we'll start right here.

a nice one, there.

leave a lot of these dark areas showing.

be careful that you
don't cover 'em all up.

your painting will get very, very flat.

look at all the snow on those.

okay.

and work 'em in layers so
you have distance in here.

do one bush at a time.

okay, we'll put a few
little sticks in here.

mmmkay.

now then, let's lay a
little snow into this side.

just using straight titanium white.

this is very firm.

and let it break, so you
have shadows showing through.

just like when we do the
mountains, let it break.

okay.

there we go.

and we lay the snow in like so.

and maybe, maybe there was
an old trapper that lived out

here and one day he went
to check his beaver traps

and maybe he fell into the
river here and drowned, but his

old cabin's still here, so
let's draw an old cabin in.

i suggest you scrape it with
a knife first, scrape out the

basic shape.

it gets rid of the thin,
loose paint underneath.

it's also a good way to lay
out your general shape of your

cabin, get your perspective right.

there we go.

just very basic shape,
that's all we're looking for.

big thing is to get rid
of all that loose paint.

and we'll take some van dyke
brown and we'll do the far eave

out here first.

there.

there we go.

now, we'll take some titanium
white, and let's lay some

snow on the roof.

over here.

there.

let's bring this all together.

there we go.

now, we need to have a
little snow on the other side

of the roof, so we'll just take
a little white on the knife

and lay it in like so.

little more brown, and
we'll begin putting all this

together.

there we go.

a fantastic way to make a little cabin.

there.

and if you want to make it
look even older, you can take

just a little bit of the white
paint and let it just sort of

bounce along here, very gently.

just let it touch and bounce.

little more dark to
create the shadows on top.

ooh, look at that.

look how old that wood looks.

it's a super way to make old
buildings and stuff if you ever

want to try it.

okay, i think we need a door in here now.

somebody might need to come
along and stay in this old

cabin, so he's got to
have a way to get in.

there we go.

and we'll take in some highlights
around the door, just by

using the knife.

and probably when this
old trapper lived here,

he's just like all the rest
of us, he ran out of room,

so he probably built him
a little shed out here.

so we'll just build us a little shed.

just bring a little
snow for the roof first.

there we go.

just like so.

take a little bit of dark paint...

a little brown...

and we need a wall over here,
so we'll just drop it in.

there.

okay, let's make this an old slab cabin.

so we'll just cut in some
slabs here with the point

of the knife.

there we go.

and we can take a little
white and clean this all up.

right now, you should begin
having a painting that's

beginning to take shape,
beginning to look well.

should be very happy with it.

and i think we've said it
before, but painting should do

one thing for you: it should
create happiness in your heart.

it should make you happy.

let's take and put a
little bush right here.

just let a few of these run down.

maybe, maybe a little bush
right here to sort of push this

cabin back into the painting.

right along that cabin.

okay, we need some highlights
on this little bush.

there we go.

okay, and we'll cut a few
little sticks here and there.

we're just cutting right
through the light paint,

letting the dark show through.

alright.

this painting's beginning
to get close to being done.

let's take the fan brush here,
and normally, i would leave

these trees very dark.

i want to take a little bit
of blue and just tap a little

so you can see them a
little better at home.

just to give you an idea.

normally i leave them very,
very dark, so they really give

the impression of night time.

like so.

okay, just here and there.

just a few little highlights.

there.

and just a few over here.

like so.

there we go.

alrighty.

i think we're gonna sign
this painting, and call it

finished.

take a little of the thin oil.

and let's sign it right here.

i hope you've enjoyed this painting.

it is a great deal of fun.

we certainly have enjoyed
being with you today.

and i hope you've painted along
with us, and you also have

an almighty painting.

all you need is the dream
in your heart and the desire

to put it on canvas.

until next time, we
wish you happy painting.

thank you very much.





- hello, i'm bob ross.

and i'd like to welcome you
to our fifth painting series.

if you've been with us before,

i hope you have your
almighty easel set up,

and you're all ready to go along with me

and paint a fantastic little painting.

and let's go across the colors

that we're going to use.

i'll have them graphically run

the colors across the screen,

starting with the titanium white,

and going all the way around.

and they'll come across your screen

in the same order that i
have them on my palette.

if you haven't been with us before,

hang around.

i think you'll really
enjoy what we're gonna do.

i've already covered the canvas

with a thin, even coat of magic white.

and the magic white, it makes the canvas

wet, makes it slick.

it allows us to literally blend
color right on the canvas.

so, let's go up here and do it.

and i'll start with a big old

two and a half inch brush today.

and we'll go right into a
little bit of thalo blue.

and we'll just work some of that

right into the bristles here.

just beat it into the bristles,

so you have a nice, even
distribution of color.



kay, let's go up to the canvas here.

maybe we'll make a, let's just make a

happy little sky here.

we just use a little,
little criss-cross strokes.



and just let the brush
just sort of bounce around

and play and

just let it have fun.

let it have fun.

a little more color.

and we'll go up here in this corner.



and i'm not coloring the
entire canvas evenly.

i'm leaving some little
spots here and there that

oh, hopefully when we're
done it'll look like

some happy little clouds
floating all across the sky.

there.



now, it's easy, it's real
easy to make the sky darker.

but, it's a son of a
gun to make it lighter.



so, use very, very little
color when you first start.

you can always go back and add more color.

now, while i've got this
old dirty brush going here,

i'm gonna reach right up into this color,

which is a little bit of thalo green.

and we want very, very small amounts.

extremely, extremely strong.

and we'll just mix it right on the brush.

there we go, a little
thalo green and thalo blue.

okay, let's go back up here.

i wanna have some water in this painting.

i love water.

and water is always level.

it's still water, it's always level.



so, just come across.

try to keep the strokes

as straight as possible.

okay, now let's go to the other side,

and pull this way.



painting, see how the color's blending in.

it's continually mixing
with the magic white.

now, you could do all these
things on the palette,

but they would take you a long time.

here we let it happen on
the, right on the canvas.



mkay.

now, i'll wash the brush.

and we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner.

i never, never wash my
brushes with turpentine.

only with odorless paint thinner.



shake off the excess.



and, that's the most fun of all.

now, with a clean, dry brush,

i'm gonna go back into the sky

and just very quickly,

blend it out a little bit.



those light spots remain.

there.

just let this happen.

we really just sort of let it just flow

right out of our mind,
right onto the canvas.

and you don't have to spend a great deal

of time planning and worrying.

just let it go. let it go.

mkay.

tell you what, let's do.

let's take an almighty fan brush here,

and we'll make a happy little cloud.

and i'm using a number six fan brush,

and some titanium white.

tell you what, let's put the least

little amount of permanent red in there.

put a little sunshine on it.

want some sunshine in our clouds.

load a lot of paint into the bristles.

lot of paint.

kay, now let's go up to the canvas here.

maybe.

maybe, maybe, right here.

using just the corner of the brush.

we'll put a happy little cloud.

and clouds are very, very free.

very free, just let 'em
bounce around and play.

and we're looking for
areas here that are thick,

areas that are thin,
areas that have no paint.

keep the brush moving.

keep it moving.

if you let it stay in one place,

and keep doing this, you're gonna

you're gonna end up with a
big cotton ball up in the sky.

let it move.



i tell you what, let's go
over to the other side here.

maybe there's a happy little cloud that.

yeah, there was.

he lives right there.

just let him go.

there he is.

and you put these clouds
wherever you want 'em.

this piece of canvas is your world.

it's your world.

and you make your world
the way you want it.

now then, i'm gonna take

a clean, dry, two and a half inch brush

and i wanna blend, i want to blend

the bottom of these clouds out

without touching the top.

so let's start right
here, and very lightly.

very lightly, very lightly.

three hairs and some air.

just let it caress the canvas.

barely, barely, barely touching.

blend the bottom out.

leave the top of the cloud alone.

kay, let's do this one.

and work in layers.



kay now, let's fluff this cloud.

now watch what happens.

we're gonna lift this cloud up.

and you're gonna pull little,

little stringy things of paint up,

don't worry about 'em,
don't worry about 'em.

you want those to happen right now.

and then very lightly, you just blend 'em,

and it brings all of it together.

kay, let's do that again
over here on the other side.

just blend the bottom of the cloud out.



just like so.

fluff it up.

and then blend it.

and this little son of a gun here,

we don't want to forget him.

and we'll just blend him out.

and fluff him up.

and then very lightly,

very lightly.

and that easy,

that easy, you've got some beautiful,

beautiful, very effective little clouds.

okay, i'll wash my brush.

there's a screen in the bottom of this can

that i scrub the brush against.

it really helps.

helps get the paint out of the brush.

i tell you what, my home
is in fairbanks, alaska,

so i'm sort of hung up on mountains.

so let's build a fantastic
little mountain here.

go ahead and take some thalo blue,

some van dyke brown,

and we'll use a little
bit alizarin crimson.

so we have thalo blue, van dyke brown,

and a small amount of alizarin crimson.

now, the more crimson you put in,

the more purplish your
mountain's gonna be.

pull this paint out very flat,

and just cut across it so you
have a small roll of paint.

there, right out on the edge of the knife.

let's go up here.

now, you have to make some
decisions in your world.

where's the mountain gonna live?

i'm gonna have my
mountain live right there.

and you're really, really pushing

this paint into the canvas.

really push it into the canvas.

and anywhere you decide there's a bump

or hill or big stone,

put it in.

put it in.



this is where ya exert your

fantastic power

is right here.

kay, now

see you scrape off the excess paint.



and the canvas will keep what it wants.

the value is in the material.

kay, now, i wanna remove more

excess paint and blend this out.

because the canvas is wet,

this paint will move, it'll slide.

you can move it all over the canvas.

there we go, and just pull it out.

and when you're painting mountains

always remember

if you can see the entire mountain

it's always more distinct at the top

than it is at the bottom.

at the bottom of the mountain

we have mist and

now we have pollution.

all these things have a tendency

to break up and diffuse light.

and you can see from that the top

of the mountain's very
dark, it's very strong.

and down at the bottom of the mountain

then it's very soft and quiet, peaceful.

and that's what we're looking for.

kay, now i'm gonna go

right into my titanium white.

we'll put a little snow on this mountain.

little bit of snow.

pull it out very flat.

very, very flat.

just like we did before.

and then cut across it.

get that small roll of paint.

okay, let's go up here.

now, you have to make some decisions.

which one of these peaks
is the farthest away?

the one that's farthest
away, let's do it first.

there. just follow
right down the mountain.

no pressure. absolutely no pressure.

no pressure.

all that's touching the canvas is that

little roll of paint that's on the knife.

and then you begin thinking about

where the light would strike as it

just comes through here.

now, some people find it easier

to put the shadow on first.

personally, i like to put
the highlight on first.

and then put the shadow in later.

but, either way that works for you.

there are no set, firm rules in painting.

you find what works for you.

and that's what you do.



there we go.

and you can bring this down to

wherever you want it.

you can end up covering your
whole canvas with mountains,

which is a super way to practice.

i'm gonna take some thalo blue

and titanium white and
we'll mix that together.

and to that, i'm gonna add a
small amount of van dyke brown.

the brown is there

just to dull it down.

and i'm not worried about overmixing that.

just leave that paint marbled.

okay, and once again we'll
take that little roll of paint.

let's go up here.

and, we'll go in the opposite direction.

the opposing direction,
whatever you wanna call it.

and, put in some shadows.

and every shadow

needs it's own little, private highlight.

or he won't play.

he'll just disappear on ya.

look at that, look at that.

i've painted for over

excites me to see these things happen.

it's unbelievable.

i was a traditional painter for many years

and i suffered and ah my gosh.

would spend weeks and weeks

and weeks on a painting.

and when i got finished
i had turned it to mud.

or i was so tired of looking at it,

i didn't want to paint on it anymore.

and this

this offers you unlimited freedom.

unlimited freedom.

and that's what we're all looking for.

little bit of highlight right there.

now, let's just sort of
bring these together.

maybe it comes from right here.

and just let it

just let it sort of work together.

i guess i'll

come right there

just like that.

and you can keep adding

just wherever you think there should be a

almighty peak.

that's where it should be.



there.

and on this series, we're gonna try to

i'm gonna bring in a couple of friends.

i think i'll bring in a couple of friends

and let them to show you some

fantastic things that can be done.

the more people that
you see that can do this

the more you'll understand
that you can do it too.

there's no big secret to it.

anybody can do it if they're

willing to practice a little bit.

now, we'll take the large brush.

i wanna create some mist down here.

so, here i'm tapping.

just lightly tapping.

paying particular attention to the angles.

always follow the angles in your mountain.

and then we'll lift up.

very lightly, lift upward.

and look at that.

creates a very soft misty, misty effects.

maybe, let's play a game.

let's play a little bit here.

maybe one of these peaks here

show you how to bring a mountain.

oh let's, i tell you what.

we're having such a good time here,

show you something else
too while i'm here.

i'm gonna take a little of the magic white

and add it right into my titanium white.

so it's a little bit thinner.

one of our golden rules.

thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

and i wanna

i wanna put a cloud coming
right across the mountain here.

just, let it come right across.

you know, these old clouds,

they just sort of drift across a mountain.

so, just barely touch.

and this is a thinner paint

and it'll stick on top of that thick paint

that's already up there.

okay, maybe he's got a little friend

that lives right here.

and maybe, shoot who knows.

maybe there's a happy little cloud

that he sort of, maybe
he fell out of the sky,

and he just floating right down here

at the bottom of this mountain.

and, we'll take the big brush.

just blend that.

looka there.

fluff it up.

fluff it up, up.

and then very lightly, we'll
just blend all this together.

and we'll put a happy little cloud

right there at the bottom of the mountain.

and you can put as many of
these in here as you want.



and maybe, tell you what.

let's just bring this one

right down in front of the cloud.

and you can just keep
adding on and on and on.

wherever you want it to go.

look at that.



look at that.

then we'll drop a happy
little shadow here and there.

see how that shadow makes it just pop out.

that's where it happens.

now, we could spend the whole show

working on mountains here.

but, i'm sure we wanna
look at some other things.

so we'll just put some mist right here.



over here, we follow these angles.

soften all this up.

and go from there.

and that easy.

now you can see how
this plane projects out.

the little mist in here and the softening.

it just brings it right out.

tell you what, i'm gonna mix up

we'll just use the same mountain color

and we'll put sap green into it.

so we have blue, brown a
little alizarin crimson

and now a touch of sap green into it.



just a little though.

okay. now let me clean my knife.

we'll use the fan brush.

and i'll just quickly
lay a little on here.

now, i wanna have maybe,
like a little tree line

going up the side of this mountain.

so i wanna do in here where
the fan brush is just touching.

and you still, still need to follow

the angles in that mountain.

always follow the angles in that mountain.

and that easy. that easy.

you can put a whole forest nearly

just climbing right up
the side of the mountain.

there we go.

and all we're doing is laying
it on with the fan brush.



just lay it on.

then we'll take a one-inch
brush, just clean and dry.

and very lightly

begin lifting straight up.

just straight up.

there we go.

barely, barely touching.

now this softens and
brings everything together.

that easy.

that easy.

you know it's hard for me to believe

that we're into our fifth series.

oh my gosh it was

it's

you can't believe what wonderful things

it does to my heart to know that

you've allowed me into your home

this many times and you're
inviting me back again.

you've

literally made a dream come true.

all my life i have wanted to

to be able to share

my views of nature

with everybody.

and you've allowed me to do it.

and now,

i want to thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

it's very special to me.

kay, let's go up here.

maybe

back in here there's

there it is.

you knew it was there.

some happy little trees
that live way back here.



and this is that same color.

same, same color.



there we go.

there we go.

and all you're looking for is distant,

distant indications here.

we don't want

we don't want a lot of detail yet.

when things are far away

you don't see all the detail that you see

when they're close up.

so, lack of detail sometimes
can be as important as detail.

just let these little trees grow

wherever you think they should.

and don't worry about
covering up some of this

because it's gonna show through,

and that's what makes it look real.

nature doesn't move trees just so it's

pretty for ya.

they grow wherever makes 'em happy.



very quickly here we'll just drop in

some happy little things here.

same color, same color.

that's all there is to it.

same, same old color.

very dark color.

now, this fan brush has
a little white on it.

i wanna put some little indications maybe

a few little tree trunks back here.

so, all i'm doing is lifting upward.

very lightly.

very few. don't get crazy.

don't get too many here.

just a few, just a few.

and if you get one that's too light,

all you have to do is rub it a little bit,

and it'll pick up that
dark color underneath,

and it'll go away.

now then, let's put some highlight here.

i'm gonna start with

this is cadmium yellow.

put a little yellow ochre into it.

and some sap green.

and we'll just mix these
right on the fan brush.

a lot of paint in the brush.

lot of paint.

just work that brush.

but, you can see all the layers of color.

and when you mix on the brush,

you get all these different layers.

you don't have one flat, old, dead color.

and we're looking for
a bright, shiny color.

kay.

now we touch and push

bend upward.

just bend that brush upward.

can you see how that's a

touch it, push it and bend it.

and that makes all those
little grassy things.

way back here in the distance.

far, far away.

maybe there's, maybe, maybe
comes right down through.

wherever you want it.

there it goes.

there it goes, right up through there.



right on up

and you just sort of make
these little paintings

up in your mind as you go along.

let 'em happen.

now, i want some reflections on there.

so, i'm gonna touch

a small, small amount of the thalo blue.

i want the reflections to
have a little more blue

cast to 'em.

and go right up here and

i'm gonna pick up a
little bit of the color.

and it's gonna mix with the blue.

and all of it's gonna
mix with the magic white.

and instant, instant reflections.

this may be one of the
most fantastic things

that happens in this technique.

is some of the most
spectacular reflections

imaginable.

and it's easy.

so easy.



there we go.

and then, very lightly, go across.

this'll give it a watery appearance.

that easy.

now then.

maybe there's some stones back here.

so let's take some burnt umber.

and i'll use yellow ochre.

yellow ochre and burnt umber.

put a little titanium white in there too.

what the heck.

that'll be our highlight color.

and then we can start with
just straight van dyke brown.

and put in our base color.

we'll just drop in some
happy little things

♫ do doodle do do doo

♫ do doodle de do ♫

there you go.

just let 'em happen.

and painting, painting
should make ya happy.

should bring a song to your heart.

make you appreciate life.

all the beautiful things that
are happening around you.

take time to

take time to look at nature,

to appreciate it.

sometimes we

we look at it everyday and we

we have a tendency to overlook it.

okay, this is that highlight color.

it's yellow ochre and burnt umber,

and a little titanium white.

see, and you get all these things

because you don't over mix your paint.

let it

let it happen.

don't fight it.

that's what it's all about.

just relax.

be calm, peaceful.

and let it go.

okay, now then

we'll take

and let's just drop in some

some little grassy areas coming
right down through there.

wherever you want 'em.

over here a few.

and that sort of just
ties it all together.

and now i'll use a little
of the magic white.

very thin.

and we'll drop in a happy
little water line back here.

just like so.



and the beauty of this,

the beauty of this technique

is that right in the middle of it

you can change your mind.

you can redesign paintings.

because this is your world.

you can do anything that you
want to do in this world.

anything that you wanna do.



wash that brush real quick.

okay, a little of the magic white.

a little titanium white.

maybe, who knows, who knows.

maybe back here there's just a

little indication.

there it is. look at that.

look at that.

a little stream lives right there.

and just, it drops right in here

and puts some water
right into our painting.

right into our painting.

a few little happy, grassy things.

and that easy.

that easy.

you can just put you
a happy little stream.

little foam here where it's

coming out into this river, lake or pond.

whatever you want it to be.

okay, now we can

we can get over here into the foreground

and really have some fun.

so, i'm gonna take all the
dark colors that i got.

there's brown, there's blue

oh there's some crimson,
big gob of sap green.

big thing is that it's dark.

kay, let me get a big brush here.

and i'll just use this old, dirty brush.

we'll go right up into this color.

wiggle that brush.

wiggle, wiggle, wiggle that brush.

bring it to a nice sharp, sharp edge.

see if you can see that. see.

it's a very nice, sharp, chiseled edge.

let's go up here.

now, right here, in my world, there lives

there certainly better live there now.

a big evergreen tree.

and he just lives right in this brush.

and all you do is just go back and forth.

and push him out.

just push him out.

and there he comes.

there he comes.

don't be afraid of this
brush because it's big.

it will do absolutely fantastic things.

and right here there's
a little bush and a tree

and it comes right across.

wherever you want it.

we'll just fill all this up with dark.

you need the dark

in order for your light to show.

we can't have light without dark.

you know it's just like

it's just like in life.

you can't know happiness

unless you've known a
little bit of sorrow.

so, good lord gives us all
a little bit of sorrow,

so we can know the
happiness when it comes.

tree trunks.

little burnt umber.

♫ do do da do do to ♫

there we are.

little highlight color.

this is a little yellow ochre.

kay, now then

i'm gonna take a

one-inch brush

put a little paint thinner
on it to thin the paint.

sap green and yellow.

and let's just very quickly here

drop in some little indications of

a few highlights.

just a few indications.

darker, darker, darker
as they go down here.

if your paint,

if you have trouble making it stick,

add a little bit of paint thinner

or magic white, that'll thin your paint.

there we go.

drop in a happy little bush right there.

this is sap green, cad yellow.

just drop 'em in, wherever you want 'em.

it's your world.

tell you what

gonna add a small amount of indian yellow,

yellow ochre and some permanent red here.

i want one that

that shines right here.

just like so.

and i really hope you've enjoyed this.

it's a lot of fun.

i hope to see ya every week here with us.

and we'll teach you some
of the most fantastic

and easy paintings you've ever seen.

and they're very effective.

they'll make you happy 

your friends will never
believe you've done 'em.

mkay, now with just a clean knife here,

we can drop in a few
little sticks and twigs.

that easy. wherever you
think they should be.

just drop 'em in.



and i think we have a finished painting.

and with that,

we'll stop here.

i'd like to wish each and every one of ya

happy painting.

i look forward to seeing you next week.

good bye.



- hello, glad to see you again.

thought today we'd do a picture

that's right straight out of alaska.

we'll do one of mount mckinley,

the most almighty mountain in
the north american continent.

and we'll start off today,
and we use just a little bit

of prussian blue, maybe
a touch of phthalo green

mixed with it here.

and let's dance in some basic shapes here.

i've already put the
magic white on the canvas

to save a little time.

so we're just literally
mixing color right here

on the canvas, just let this brush

dance and play and have fun.

and all we're looking for is general basic

cloud shapes here, we're really not

trying to put anything in.

just let it happen.

just move the brush,
keep it moving, working,

playing, having fun, there we go.

isn't that something?

there we are.

put a nice little cloud shape
right there, what the heck.

okay, keep the brush
moving, don't let it stop.

and sometimes brush is lazy, you have to

really push it a little
or it'll quit on you.

make it keep moving.

okay, now we'll take
the almighty brush here,

and we're gonna swirl this.

we're gonna pull the color, move it,

pull it, there we go.

try to avoid a pattern, we
want this to go everywhere.

we're looking for a sky
here that has life in it,

has movement in it, we don't want a sky

that looks like at night
you pull the curtain down

and everything went black on you.

wanna keep this moving, there.

already you're beginning to see

all the little things happening up here.

every which direction.

every way, there we go.

now you can blend this too
much and take it all out.

we don't wanna take it out,
we just wanna mix it up.

stir it up.

okay, while we've got some
paint on the brush here,

we'll add a little more
prussian blue and phthalo green.

and we'll put us in some water.

we pull from the outside in.

and leave a little area opened here,

that will create the little sheen of light

that plays across the water.

you can go back with white
paint and put it back in,

but you've already covered
the canvas with magic white,

so why not use it?

this is a lazy man's way of painting.

you let the paint work,
you let the brushes work.

use what happens
naturally, don't fight it.

okay, clean the old brush off,

and let's get out an
almighty fan brush here.

and let's build some happy
little clouds up here.

i'm gonna take titanium white
with the least little touch

of permanent red in it.

and load the brush full of
paint, just really load it up.

now we'll start working on
some basic cloud shapes here,

and we'll dance in all these little areas

and let 'em just play in the sky.

keep the brush moving, keep it moving.

you want areas that are
thick, areas that are thin.

let all these little things happen.

and we'll take the big brush here

and gently, gently blend this together.

very lightly.

and fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.

and right there you've
got an almighty cloud,

just that quick.

but they're very easily
killed, clouds are delicate.

don't overwork it, put
it in, leave it alone.

okay, and maybe we'll
have another one here.

we'll put a, layer these clouds some.

okay.

nature is so beautiful, just
let it go, have fun with it.

very, very easy to work these to death.

okay, we'll blend this in.

and you work in layers here, you do thing

that's the farthest away first,

have him finished, and then work forward.

there, we'll hypnotize that one,

blend this one a little bit.

okay, little bit more red here.

there we go.

don't wanna set these clouds on fire now.

all we wanna do is have a
slight warmish glow to 'em,

like the sun's playing along the top.

there we go.

guess we better not forget
this side of the sky.

we'll put a little something over here.

just some nice little clouds
playing around in the sky.

okay, and mix these up a little bit.



okay, maybe a little
streaky one right here.

got baby clouds, too.

if you didn't have baby clouds,

you wouldn't have big clouds.

there, and we can work on
this one a little touch.

okay, there looks like a nice place.

and we're really pushing
this paint into the canvas.

we're working that value
right into the canvas.

just let it play.

don't kill all the dark areas.

you can end up with great
big cotton balls in the sky

if you're not careful.

guess that'd be considered a ufo,

big cotton ball in the sky.

there, fluff that up.

and work that paint.

and look at there, in
just a couple of minutes,

you have a sky that has so
much action happening in it.

there we go, okay.



if you do this in your living room,

you can redecorate your living
room in a matter of minutes,

so be very careful, learn to control it.

have you a box you can
shake your brush in,

and that way you don't have to worry about

covering everything.

okay, let's take a little
bit of brown, some blue,

a little touch of alizarin
crimson and some white.

there we go, and don't
mix your paint dead.

mix it marbley and leave it alone.

okay, now let's do, since
we're gonna do mckinley today,

let's do the basic shape here.

mckinley comes down like
so, has another peak

running right off through here.

make that just a little more rounded.

there, and we let this side
drop right down and over.

all you're looking for
here is the basic outline,

the basic shape of this mountain.

you're not worried at
all what happens in here.

okay, take the big brush,
and we'll pull that down.

this takes off the excess paint

and makes the next layer stick better.

and also when you're doing mountains,

if you can see the entire
mountain, the top of the mountain

is always more distinct than the bottom.

at the bottom of the
mountain we have mist,

and now we have pollution.

we have a multitude of
things that break up

and diffuse light.

okay, and we'll put some snow
on that almighty mountain.

pull that paint out real
flat, just pull it out

and get us a little roll of paint.

and we'll just lay this on and
let it travel right on down.

and you want the paint to break like this,

to make all the little
things that happen in there,

the little shadows, the
light and dark areas.

okay, and there's a little bump

that comes out right there

and works its way down.

and over here, let this drop just like so.

there we go.

now for the shadow
color, we'll use a little

prussian blue and white.

and once again, don't mix it dead.

you want it to be sort of marbley.

okay, now we'll start with the shadows,

and we'll just lay these in here.

we wanna bring these
two areas here together.

so we just sorta work it back and forth

and let it come, there you go,

let it just come together.

and maybe this shadow comes
right down through here.

every highlight needs
its own private shadow.

okay, we'll put a little
shadow right there.

and see how that protrudes that up?

makes it just jump right out at you.

the little ridges here and there.

all kind of little things
happening in this mountain.

and we need a shadow back here
behind this almighty peak.

there it is.

just let him go.

okay, and we want a peak that
comes right up through here

and just begins working its way back down.



there.

it's a nice ridge coming through here.

and we can bring these together.



a few little shadows in here.

just here and there.

okay.

and as we say, we want
this to be more distinct

at the top than the bottom, so we're gonna

diffuse the bottom of
it, and only the bottom.

and here we're just tapping the canvas.

we're trying not to destroy, only diffuse.

and this is where you really
depend on a firm paint.

if you have a loose, oily, thin paint,

you become a mud mixer here.

so when you try this at home,

if you find that you're
making a lot of mud,

check your paint, it
should be very, very firm.

squeeze that tube, it
should stand up maybe about

three-quarters of an inch above the tube.

then you have a nice firm paint.

okay, i'm gonna make the same
color and make it darker.

blue, brown, and alizarin added to it.

'cause i want this
mountain to be in front.

this is a beautiful study
of how to make one mountain

look very, very big.

and we'll put some
little smaller mountains

here in the foreground.



okay, another little peak here.

and we'll take the big
brush and pull that out.

son of a gun, this comes right out.

that's the beauty of painting wet on wet.

you can move paint on the canvas.

and we'll put some happy little snow here.

just let that run.

there we go.

okay.

our light is still coming
from the same direction here,

so don't let that fool you.



okay, now we can work
in some shadows here.

let's push that one into the background,

just come right on through,
and that'll push him back.

it's scary to have this much power

that you can move mountains.

okay, this, there.

we can swing this around
and bring these two

right together.

just make a nice little ridge out of that.

okay, now we've got an almighty mountain.

i'm gonna take a little
of the blue, brown,

alizarin crimson, add a little
touch of sap green to it.

looking for a dark color here, very dark.

i will load up this one-inch brush,

and we'll push in some
little dark areas here.

this'll be our little
trees that are way, way

back in the distance, bushes and trees

and all the little things
happening back here.

there we go.

now with the big brush,
we can pull a little bit

of this color down.

and this'll be the beginning
of our reflections.

okay, and we'll just give
it a little bit of ripple

to make it look watery.



okay, let's put some highlights on here.

i'm gonna use a little bit of magic white

mixed with some cad yellow.

little touch of permanent red.

and we'll just sorta go back and forth,

make a nice orangey
color here, bright color.

mm.

there we go, all these nice little bushes

happening back here.



and then we'll reflect some of that

right down into the water here.

there we go.

now with a big brush and
the most delicate, delicate

touch possible, just
enough to pull the paint

a little bit, we'll pull that down

and just give it a watery
effect, don't wanna destroy it.

okay, now let's take...

mix up a lot of dark here,
blue, brown, alizarin,

and a little bit of sap green.

should look black to you.

and we'll load the brush
full of paint, load it full.

a lot of paint.

and let's make some little evergreen trees

that are growing way back
here in the distance.



okay.

let's firm that one up a little bit.

it needs to be a little stronger.

there we go.

maybe he's got a friend
that lives right over here.

just dropped him in.



okay, maybe they're
getting a little bigger

as it comes around the curve.

maybe a little baby one back here.

okay, we'll put a little
bush in front of him.

okay, we'll take a little
touch of magic white,

a little bit of brown,

and a little touch of yellow

just to make a nice sandy looking color.

and we'll lay in a little
water line back here.

there we go.

and we'll cut in a few little trunks

and sticks here and there.



okay.

maybe we need another tree right here.

trees are getting closer,

so they're getting a little bigger.

they look bigger to you, this is the way

we push everything back.

work with perspective here.

okay, let's move to the
other side of the picture

while we've got a brush
full of paint here,

and we'll put an almighty tree right here.

these trees live in your brush.

you have to scare 'em out
sometimes, really work at 'em.

little son of a guns
will try to avoid you.

and they're like everything else.

the first time you try 'em, they're gonna

drive you up the wall.

but you practice it.

if there's a secret to
this, it is practice.

you learn how to make the brush work,

how to touch the canvas with it.

and then it's just a matter of practicing.

first time you tied your
shoe, it wasn't easy.

you had to look at it and work at it.

the next thing you know, you're not paying

any attention, you just,
you get your shoe tied.

same thing.

okay, we'll just...

maybe we'll make another little projection

come right out through here, there we go.

a little reflection in here.

and we'll pull that down.



okay, we'll lay in some more of these

pretty colors back here.

there's a nice little bush right there.

mm, there's one.

and right down here we'll
reflect some of these.

okay, delicate touch
again, very, very light.

just enough to move it a
little bit on the wet canvas.

and we'll put some land out here

so these bushes have a place to sit.

don't want 'em fall off in the river here,

so we'll give 'em
something to set on here.

and we can take a clean brush
and just lift that gently.

this is a very thin paint
now, it's mostly magic white.

so you can move that without destroying

what's underneath it.

and here we'll use a little bit of just

straight magic white,

and we'll put us a happy
little water line in here.

there.

okay.

now then, you can, you can put some more

little bushes right in here like so.

and we'll drop some
reflections into the water.

and we'll pull those down.

and anybody can do this, this
is not some big secret thing.

anybody can do it, we teach
people from the age of 10

all the way up 80 and 90 years old.



and young people really, really like this.

they learn it very easily, very quickly,

and they see results very quickly.

i have a son that's a young man right now,

and he was, oh, he's been painting

since he was about 12 years
old, been selling his work.

so it's not just for the older person.

it will also work very
well for the young person.

the only trouble, like
my son, he's quite lazy.

he'll only paint if he needs money.

if he needs money, he'll paint.

but it is a nice way to put
a happy buck in your pocket.

and to make good things
happen in your heart.

okay, we'll just have this come
right on down through here.

fill that in.

okay, now we can start
highlighting some of these things.

we'll take a little bit of
blue and yellow mixed together,

make a very nice little green color here.

and we'll just drop some
highlights on this tree.

remember where your light's coming from.

light's coming from the right,

so you want the right-hand
side of this tree

to be a little more distinct
and bright than the left side.

and if you're right handed,
you'll probably find

it's easier to have the
light coming from the right.

if you're left handed,
it will sort of vary

from person to person.

okay.

let's put some little highlights over here

on these little trees.

the sun wouldn't forget them.

there we go.



there we are now.

a little more magic white,
thin that down just a touch.

and we can start finding all
these beautiful little trees

and bushes that are living in here.

very important that you don't
kill all this dark area.

if you kill all the dark,

your picture's gonna be very flat.

well, we might as well reflect that

right into the water there.

okay, and there we go.

a little bit right in here.

and we'll reflect that right on down,

a little touch of red over the top.

okay, there's another nice tree i see.

little rascals live in your brush,

you just gotta push 'em out.

and let's put a touch
more of the magic here.

there, nice ochre color.

all these pretty little bushes,

just let 'em flow off your brush.

and some little grassy areas
coming down through here.

let's turn that into a nice reflection.

just like so.

okay, now let's give him
a little bit of dirt.

there we go.

this is straight van dyke brown.

and onto that, we'll take
a little brown and white

and give him just a
little touch of highlight,

make him look like little stones and rocks

playing through here.

okay, let's put a few little
sticks here and there.

here we're just cutting through the paint

using the point of the knife.

but it shows distance, it shows
all these different planes.

okay.

and we'll put just a little
bit of magic white under here

and give us a little water line.



there we go, and a few
little sticks over here.

okay, but you see what you
can do in just a few minutes

with an almighty brush
and an almighty knife

and a beautiful painting in your heart.

all you have to do is let it out.

a few more sticks.

there we go, i think
we'll call that finished,

and i wanna thank you very,
very much for watching us.

i hope to see you again
in the near future.

until then, happy painting, thank you.



- hi, welcome back.

i'm certainly glad you
could join me today.

i thought today we'd just do a

fantastic little seascape.

i'll show you how easy
you can do one of those.

let's start out and have them run

all the colors across the screen

that you need to paint along with me.

while they're doing that,

let me show you what i've got done.

have my regular old canvas up here,

except today i've covered
the bottom part of it here

and up the side, with black gesso.

and i've allowed that to dry completely.

and after it's dry, be sure it's dry,

it takes about 30 - 40
minutes for it to dry.

and it's totally different
now than liquid black.

this is black gesso, which is an acrylic.

then we've taken transparent color.

i've put a little alizarin crimson

and dark sienna mixture in here.

and a little sap green
and brown down in here.

down here is just a little brown.

the white part we've covered,
as usual, with liquid white.

so it's completely wet and ready to go.

so let's just have some fun today.

i'm gonna start out with
the old two-inch brush.

we'll go into the least little
touch of the indian yellow.

just a small amount.

and we'll go right up here.

and let's just dance in
a happy little sky today.

let's do a seascape that's very
bright and shiny and pretty.

there we go, little cad yellow.

vary the yellows here.

started with indian yellow,
now we're into cad yellow.

shoot, now i'm gonna go into
a little bit of yellow ochre.

and yellow ochre's sort of a
gold color, it's very pretty.

very pretty color, i like it.

we just let it come right on around,

maybe something like that.

wherever, just make some decisions.

then we'll take a little of the bright red

and we have not cleaned the brush yet.

i like these kind of paintings
where i don't have to

clean the brush much, i'm
sort of a lazy painter.

there.

but by allowing these
colors to blend on the brush

and on the canvas, you get a multitude of

different values and colors,

rather than just one old flat color.

shoot, put some excitement in your world.

there we go.

i tell you what, let's just paint it

all the way down here to the water line.

this is just a little
piece of masking tape

i have across here.

just to keep the water line straight.

there.

sometimes my hand's a little shaky,

so i need all the help i can get.

so we just use a little
piece of masking tape.

you don't have to have that
there, if you don't want it.

just makes it a little easier.

gently, gently blend all these together.

maybe i'll put a little
of that color on the brush

up here too, just to fill in the sky.

just blend it all together.

so you can't tell where one color stops

and the next color starts.

there we go.

and you can make this
brighter or duller, whatever.



okay.

now then, let me grab another brush.

i have several brushes going,

so i don't have to spend
all my time washing them.

i'm gonna go right into
a little titanium white.

pure titanium white.

right up here, i'm gonna
put a little of this white.

i wanna make a bright spot in this sky.

it won't look all that
bright at this point,

but it will when we get
a little further along.

there.



just really give a nice sparkle up here.

okay.

maybe, maybe ... i didn't
realize how much i said that,

till a little boy one
day, about ten years old,

began mocking me.

he was walking around saying,

"maybe, maybe, maybe."



all right, i'm gonna make up
a little lavender color here,

using alizarin crimson and phthalo blue.

much, much more crimson than blue.

something like so.

let me clean off the old knife.

and here's a dirty brush,
we'll just use that.

has a little of that sky color on it.

i'm just gonna tap the bristles into that.



just tap a little bit, like so.

let's go up in here and let's
make some nice little clouds

that just float around
and have fun all day.

just sorta wind 'em up
and put 'em in there, see.

there.

okay.

wherever you think they should be.



i'm gonna just have 'em
come right over here.

this is gonna be a big cliff, i think.

a big rocky thing lives right there.

just drop it in.

all right, there we go.

and by using these little twisting

or circular patterns here, it creates

a multitude of little
things happening up here.

it's not just a flat ol' dead sky.

lot of nice things going on.

there.

okay.

maybe we'll come right over in here.

and i'm just gonna put clouds
all over the sky like this.

okay, there we are.

maybe it comes right down.

just load a little more color.

there.

maybe there's a little
protrusion right out here.

wherever you want 'em.

there.

i tell you what, while i'm doing this,

because this is going
to take just a second.

i wanna show you one
of my little characters

that's living with me now.

i have three little baby
squirrels that i'm raising

and they are they cutest little devils.

we took a little video of 'em,

and i wanna share that with
you while i'm doing this.

and i won't do anything
i don't tell you about

while that's coming on there.

now these are tiny little baby ones.

they're just beginning
to get a little fur.

i've had them now since just
after their eyes opened.

these little rascals
are hungry continually.

so, i thought i'd show
you how we feed 'em.

to do that, we take ... i
just use a little syringe,

with a little nipple on the end of it.

it's just like goin' to the
doctor and gettin' your shot

when it's feeding time here.

we fill'er up and normally though,

when you see a syringe comin' at you,

sorta scares you a little
bit, but in this case,

when my little friends here
see a syringe coming at 'em,

they get excited.

this just makes their whole day.

it's hard to get 'em
to eat, as you can see.



i think they'll eat
about every 15 minutes,

if you'd feed 'em.

i have three of those little rascals now

and they live with me,
and my mother and i,

and nancy, we all take care
of these little devils.

they're gonna soon be big enough

to turn loose and let 'em go.

there.

i'm just putting in a few
little clouds down here,

while you was watching
the little squirrels.

still just using the corner of the brush

and just making little circular patterns.

just round and around and around we go.

just sorta stir it up.

just stir it up, is all we're
trying to do at this point.

but we don't want a lot
of paint on the canvas.

all we're looking for is a little stain.

there.

sometimes you can just decide where

it should be a little
darker, a little lighter.

shoot, maybe there's
even a little projection

that comes right out through there.

see, that easy.

just by tapping.

you can make all those little things.

okay.

grabbing another clean brush.

this is clean, has nothing on it.

it's very dry.

and with that, you can just
begin blending this now.

to any degree of softness
or harshness that you want.

just blend it.

aren't those little squirrels cute?

i really like those little devils.

they're so much fun.

you spend a little time with
one of these, and it certainly

makes you appreciate nature
and all of god's wisdom

when he created these little characters.

you get addicted to 'em.

especially my young friends.

i have a lot of children that
live around where i live,

and i let 'em come over and help me

feed the little squirrels and
look at 'em, and hold 'em.

i think everybody should
have the opportunity

to make friends with a
little guy like that.

if you do, you'll certainly
have a greater appreciation

of nature and all the little things

that are runnin' around that we don't

pay a lot of attention to.

there we go.

now then.



just knockin' off the excess paint.

very gently, very gently,
we can just blend that.

but isn't that a fantastic
way of making a sky that's ...



sun gonna jump out and get you.

and you can do that.



all right, time to wash your brush.

and as you now, we wash our brushes

just with odorless thinner.





just beat the devil out of 'em.

maybe i'll wash two, i dirtied up

several while we were doing that.



that's double your pleasure.

okay, now the little piece
of masking tape right here.

let's take it off.



see, now that leaves you with

a very straight, smooth horizon.

but there was no color
under that, so i'll take

a little bit of the crimson
and little dark sienna.

i'm just gonna, probably
this won't even show up,

but i'm just scrubbing a little
transparent color on there.

just bringin' that all together.

this is just the crimson
and a little dark sienna.

there, right up to the water line.

okay, just sorta blend it together.



all right.

now then, we have to make
some big major decisions here.

you know me, i like to have
these big crashing waves.

i don't like just doing
these little subdued waves,

but if you like those, you
can do those the same way

as we do the little waves
in the back, very simply.

maybe, in our world, our
wave's gonna live right here.

you can take a fan brush or filbert brush

and just make sort of
a little outline of ...



there.

that's gonna be our wave, right there.

now then, with a little
touch of the titanium white,

and i'm using a number three fan brush.

i'm gonna go right up here to
the horizon and just begin.

come up close right here.

i'm just making strokes
where i'm going like this.

i'm really exaggerating, but like that.

i'm exaggerating, but it looks like

little watery things back here.

there.

okay, now that's one of the nicest,

easiest, simplest little
ways that i've ever found

just to make the indication
of water back in there.

i'm gonna add the least
little touch of cad yellow

to my color right in here.

oh, that's nice.

that's beginning to sparkle.

little bit more.

see it looks like light, just
shining right across there.

there we go.

this is just some background material.

now then, let me wash the old brush.





now the fun part, right in here.

that's the eye of the wave.

we'll just take some titanium white

and just, as my son steve says,

"just mush it in there."

really push it in there hard.

you can do this several times.

if it gets like there's a
lot of color underneath,

remove that excess paint
and that remains there.

that color remains there.

we can take a little more of our white,

add a little of the cad yellow to that.

go right back in here, see there.

each time you do that
it'll get lighter in value.

or you can take a rag or
something and just wipe that out.

whichever way you'd like to do it.

maybe it comes right on back, like so.

just scrub it in.

now then.



clean, dry, two-inch brush.

i'm only gonna use the top corner

and you put it there and you just

sort of wind it up, just wiggle it.

there.

you can make this as smooth as silk.

so smooth.

but there's not a lot of movement.

you're sorta just going around
in little tight circles.

there we go.

then begin thinking about how
you want your water to flow.



there.



knock off that excess paint.

that's an easy way of just
about getting your brush clean,

without going through
that whole procedure.



there.

okay.

let me find a fan brush here,
got several of them going.

maybe, in our world, we want to have

this water crashing over something.

grab it and pull, think
about the angle though.

angles are very important.

very important.

think about that water.



make those little noises.

that really helps.

there.

just think about it crashing over.

that's all that we need at this point.

now, if you want to bring some of that

dark back with a clean brush,

you can just grab it and lift it upward.

that'll very gently blend it all together.

see there.

you can work back and
forth, until you get it

exactly the way that you want it.

okay, let me go back and get my

little number three fan brush.

i like this little fan brush.

it's good for makin' little foamy things,

and stuff like that.

take a little white and
then i'm going into that

nice lavender color we used in the sky.

make sort of a medium value lavender.

okay, let's go back up in here.

now then, let's start thinking about

having some nice foam out here.

just using the corner of the
fan brush, and once again,

you can do this with a
filbert, just as well.

the little number six filbert
brush would work just as well.

i just happened to have
this, so we'll use it.

all we're doing here is
putting in some shadows.

some nice dark areas for the foam.

think about the water
churning and bubbling

and splashing and carrying on.



crashing.

maybe it comes right
over here, i don't know.

wherever you want it.

okay, i'm gonna wash that old brush.



i like to do seascapes.

they're a lot of fun and they'll force you

to study water and how it
moves and churns, and etc.

go to the ocean.

or get a video, or photographs
of water, just study.

if you don't live near the
ocean, then look in books

and videos and stuff like that,
and you can see all of this.

now, i've got just titanium
white and i'm going

right up here on top of this darker color.

just gonna take the fan brush here

and scrub in a little highlight.

wipe the brush off when you load it,

so you have nice, clean color.

there.

just wipe it on a paper towel in between.

think about that water, hittin'
and splashin' and churning.

make up little stories
and sounds in your mind

and just let it happen.

let it happen.

there.



now then, back to our large brush.



i use the large brush,
only because it seems

to have a little more hair
in it, and it blends better.

you could do this with a one-inch
brush, if you would like.

i'm sort of hung up on this ol'
big brush, but try 'em both.

see which one works the best for you.

that's the one you are to use.

maybe over here, a little
bit right in here too.

just that nice churning.

maybe there's even a little,
splashin' down like that.

whatever.

there.

that ol' water is comin'
down through here.

i'm gonna add the least
little touch of phthalo blue

into that color.

i want a little bluish
... oh, that's nice.

that is nice, i like that.

begin thinking about how
your water is coming up.

right up in this transparency, or the eye.

just phthalo blue and white, once again.

there.

maybe it comes down here and ...



think about shape though.

maybe there's a nice ...

shoot, maybe there's something right here.

let that water come up and fall over.

we're creating a trough
or a valley in here.

okay, here it comes.

there.

just wherever.



little bit more of the
phthalo blue and white.

there.

just let that splash and curl.



big things comin' down through here.

this is what gives shape
and form to your wave.

i tell you, maybe, even in here,

let's just use the corner of the brush.

maybe the water's splashing,
crashing right along in here.

there may be another
little splasher in there.

who knows?

this is your world, so you can do

anything that you want to do.

anything that you want to do.

let me take a large brush.

and just sort of blend that together.

we're beginning to get
into little bit of that

sap green and van dyke brown
stuff that's down here.

all right, let me get the liner brush out.

i like that little liner brush.

we'll take that.

i wanna go into a little bit
of that same lavender color

that had a little white in it,
same color we have up here.

let's just sorta highlight this edge here,

with a little color.

make it nice and firm.

then begin putting in some little shapes.

just some little doers in there that

create all the little shapes

and stuff that you want in here.

paint thinner with a little
color, is all i have here.

use a little of that
blue and white in here.

this is where you can begin

putting in all kinds of little details.

at home you have unlimited time.

you can really set and make beautiful

little things in there, put
all those little details.

while i've got that
going, maybe back in here

you can see all these little doers.

little titanium white
with paint thinner on it.

highlight some of the brighter ones,

where you think light would hit.

there.

as i say, these little details is what

really will make your
seascape spectacular.

now then.

okay.

reach down here, get a little

touch more of that paint thinner.

just let some of these little things

wiggle and jiggle and your hand shake.

i've had people write and tell me

they had a little nervous
twitch in their hand,

they had a hard time painting.

sometimes, that's a very valuable asset.

use it to your advantage.

there.

tell you what.

let's have some fun.

now, this big ledge up here,

i've already covered that
with a little bit of brown,

as i mentioned earlier.

let's take a little dark sienna,

grab a little white, alizarin crimson.

just sorta mix those loosely.

i'm just gonna mix 'em on a brush.

maybe even a little touch
of the yellow ochre.

not much, just a little.

okay, just on the fan brush.

let's go up here.

let's begin thinking about shapes here.

all you have to do is just tap.

take the fan brush and tap.

that's really all it amounts to.

and you can begin forming your rocks.

just by tapping, just tap.

in here and there you can
add a little light color.

wherever you think light would
strike and bounce and play.

there.

leave some dark areas in here.

dark areas will end up being
big holes in the rocks.

little place for the seagulls to go.

they gotta have a place to build a nest.

in alaska, we have little puffins.

they're one of the cutest
little birds god's ever made.

looks like their beak's
too big for their head.

beautiful little birds.

there.

but just form these, just like so.

and you could do this with a knife.

i just want to show you several
different ways of doing it.

but the knife will work very well

for making very nice rock effects.

there, try to stand out of
the way so you can see there.

maybe this comes right on down
into here somewhere, like so.

i got several fan brushes going,

let me get another one here.

i want a rock on the other side too.

right there.



i bet you knew i was going to
put a rock there, didn't you?

i always like big rocks,
big trees in my paintings.

just sorta decide how you think that

old rock should live in
there, and drop it in.

we can take some of that color,

come right along in here, and once again,

this is a nice way of outlining

and forming your stones and rocks.

there.



i want this one to remain quite dark.

quite dark, so it doesn't
distract too much.

there we go.

now you can take a clean,
dry, two-inch brush

and very gently, just caress it.

just caress it.

it'll blend all that together.

make it nice and smooth,

and it looks like beautiful stones then.

but very, very gently.

one hair and some air.

there.

little bit of our phthalo blue and white.

we'll have a little splash,
comin' round down through here.



shoot, maybe there's even a
little water drippin' down.

you could do this with a
liner brush or the fan brush.

just whatever.

maybe there's even a ...



right there.

look at there, let that
come right on back, like so.

see, just bring it all together.

then a little bit in the foreground.

these seascapes are not
near as hard as they look.

you really can do these.

maybe, let's get crazy.

we have a second cleft here, so we'll put

a little stone right here too.

i just like to have stones
all out in the water.

i like it, it just enhances my paintings.

little bit of the nice highlight color.

let's see here, we could
take the liner brush,

little of that phthalo blue and white,

and paint thinner.

thin it down and you can
literally have water dripping,

right off these rocks, just like so.

let some of this just ...



put all these little things in.

it's a super way though, of making

very effective little seascapes like this.

there.

okay, little bit right in there.

just make decisions,
where you think the water

would be churnin' and splashin',
maybe all around this rock.

just using the corner
of the fan brush though.

that's all we're using.

all back in here there would be.

we'll have some churning
back against that big rock.

little misty areas, like so.

and you can just keep on and on and on.

but there comes a time
when we have to stop.

i tell you what, we'll just take a touch,

a little touch of dark color.

we'll put one little lonely bird up here.

little "m" bird.

and i think with that,

we'll call this ol' painting finished.

hope this gives you an idea

of how to do a fantastic seascape at home.

if you give it a try, you will love it.

and i'd love to see some
photographs of what you're doing.

if you have time, drop us a line.

let us know if you like the show.

send us some pictures
of what you're doing.

from all of us here, i'd like to wish you

happy painting and god bless, my friend.

- hi, welcome back.

certainly glad you could join us today,

it's a fantastic day here

and i hope it is wherever you're at.

tell you what, let's start out today

and have 'em run all the
colors across the screen

that you need to paint this
little painting along with us.

while they're doing that, let me show you

what i've got done today.

have my standard old 18 x 24 inch canvas,

but you can use any size
that's convenient for you.

now, today i've taken and covered
the top part of the canvas

with liquid white.

now, liquid white's just
and oil-based medium

that makes the canvas wet and slick

and allows us to actually blend color

right on the canvas.

the bottom now, i started
with liquid black,

which is the same identical medium,

only it's black.

and i started making
little x's and i worked up

'til they blended together,

so we have a graduation
from white to black.

and with that, let's just make
a happy little scene today,

one that's fun and i think you'll enjoy.

let's start out with a
little tiny two inch brush.

there we go.

take a little bit of the thalo blue.

now, thalo blue is a
gorgeous, gorgeous blue.

beautiful color, don't need
much though, it's very strong.

tap the bristles, that
distributes the paint

all the way through the
bristles very evenly.

okay, let's go up in here.

now, i'm gonna start
up here in this corner,

just making little x's,
little criss cross strokes.

and we just dance in a
quick little happy sky.

there, very easy little sky,

something nice and simple,

we'll just drop it in like that.

there, that's all there is to it,

little something like that.

now then, go back in the same color,

only this time i'm gonna tap the bristles

firmly right into the paint,

but very little paint, just tap it.

see? just tap.

now we take that top corner of the brush

and i wanna make the
indication of a big old,

strong cloud.

we're using exactly the same color.

but just by doing something this simple,

you can create that illusion
without a lot of work.

there we go.

and i'm lazy, i look for easy ways

to make gorgeous paintings that work.

that's what makes this whole
technique so fantastic.

it works.

there we go.

something like that.

there.

this style of painting is not
for just a few special people,

anybody can do this, anybody.

i have people in their 90s
that write me letters and say,

"my fourth grade art teacher
told me i have no talent

"and i've spent my whole
life wanting to paint

"and i tried your technique and it works,

"it works."

now, those are the kind of
letters that i love to see.

there.

alright we just blend it a little bit.

now then, tell you what,

i'm gonna grab another brush,

i have several of 'em going here.

i'm gonna dip it into,
just tap it the same way

into a little bit of the titanium white,

just a small amount.

i wanna put a little
indication here and there,

maybe of a little sunlight that just

zinging through these clouds,

so i just tap in a little area,

get our little blender brush,

and very lightly you can blend that

and it might not look
like a whole lot now,

but when your painting's finished

it'll look like little light
areas where the sunlight's

playing through there.

there, it's also a nice
way of making clouds.

today i just wanna put
little indications of

little happy floaters that
are going all over the sky.

back to our little blender.

and this blender brush is so soft,

you can blend right over that firm paint

without disturbing it.

alright.

that's all there is to it.

with that we got a pretty nice little sky.

let's take black, midnght black,

alizerin crimson, a little thalo blue,

we'll put a little van
dyke brown there too,

what the heck?

it's your world, you make it
any old color you want it.

what we're looking predominantly for,

black color, dark.

cut off a little roll of paint
and it lives right there,

you can see it, lives right
on the edge of the knife.

let's go up in here.

now let's have a big
mountain that lives up here

in our world, right there.

just take the knife and
firmly push this paint

right into the fabric
of the canvas, push it.

push it, really get in there and

this is where you take
out all your frustrations

and hostilities.

get in there and

just, as my son steve says, mush it in.

there we go.

i don't know if that's a word or not,

but everybody knows what
he means when he says that.

now we'll take a two inch brush

and we wanna grab this,

this has the liquid white and black on it.

so color will move, you can
literally slide it around

on the canvas.

if this was a dry canvas,
right now you'd be

in agony city trying to pull that paint.

but it's wet and we can
move it anywhere we want it.

the only thing we're concerned with

is that nice top edge up here,

rest of it, we don't care.

we really don't care at this point.

now, let's go into, let's
just go into titanium white,

i'm gonna put the least
little bit of black into it

just to grey it down a little bit.

something about like that.

maybe even a little tiny
bit of the bright red.

pull it out as flat as you can get it.

cut across and get that
little roll of paint again.

it lives right out at
the edge of the knife.

and maybe, tell you what,

let's have the light
coming from the left today,

what the heck?

or maybe in your world, you want it

coming from the other direction.

it don't matter.

it doesn't matter, however you want it.

totally and completely up to you.

and just sort of wiggling the
knife back and forth here,

i wanna make a nice, ridge that comes

right on down like that

and let it blend outward.

no pressure, absolutely no pressure.

there, just think about where
light would zing through here.

and sometimes i use the little knife

'cause you can get in there
and put more detail in it.

but right here we have a
very limited amount of time.

shoot, i've got a mean old director,

if i don't finish in 30 minutes,
she has no sense of humor.

absolutely none.

there we go.

so we'll use the big knife,

but when you're painting at home,

find the tools and equipment that are

most comfortable to you

and that's the ones you wanna use.

that's the ones.

alright, we take a little white,

put a little thalo blue in it.

we'll make a shadow color,

i'm gonna add a little black, too,

just to dull it down.

just to dull it down a little bit.

there, nice shadow color,

same way, cut off a little roll of paint

and we go right up in here

and begin thinking where
shadows would live.

light's coming from the left,

where's all these gorgeous little shadows

gonna live in your mountain?

there, now one thing you'll find,

if you're right-handed,

normally it's easier to
have the light coming from

the right.

normally.

and i say normally because
we're all different.

what's easy for one
person is a son of a gun

for the next person, so it's up to you.

try it both ways, see what happens.

but now if you're left handed,

it's a whole different story

because i find, as anette and
i travel all over and teach,

we find that left-handed
people have been forced

all their life to do right-handed things

and for that reason,
sometimes left-handed people

prefer to highlight on
the left or the right.

it's very individual.

very individual.

my brother jim was left-handed

and i grew up with him,
so i'm used to working

with left-handed people.

there,  when we were kids,

we used to fight like cats and dogs,

you know how brothers are.

and i never expected
that left hand to get me.

boy, he used to sock me.

now he grew up and, he's bigger,

i hope he doesn't remember all that.

there we go.

he's a good man, though.

he's my best friend in the whole world.

there.

something about like that,
and you just let this go

wherever you want it.

maybe it comes right on down,

just let your imagination
take you to anywhere

that you wanna be.

anywhere, just sorta let
those blend together,

the highlights and the shadows.

gently, gently, gently work 'em together.

and we can use a little
blender brush here.

just tap it gently and very lightly.

this blender brush is
so great for softening.

there, don't know why i waited
so long to introduce it,

we just introduced this, i
think, in the last series,

it's relatively a new brush.

just wonderful, just some of
the most fantastic effects.

there, alright, we're in business.

tell you what, let's have some fun.

go back, let's use the
old two inch brush today,

what the heck?

i'm gonna go right into
the mountain color.

well, i'll change it a little,

i'm gonna add a little sap green to it.

little sap green to it,

just to change its flavor a little bit.

i'm tapping the brush
firmly right into the paint,

'cause i'm gonna paint,
i think i'll paint today,

show you how to use just the top corner

of an old two inch
brush and do some things

that are unbelievable, come right up here.

now, take the top corner
and begin tapping in

some basic little tree shapes.

we're not looking for detail yet.

all we're looking for is basic, basic

tree shapes and forms,
that's all we're looking for.

they live right here in front
of this gorgeous mountain,

what a view.

what a view, i lived in
alaska a dozen years or more

and i think, as i've
said in some other shows,

god was having a good
day when he made alaska.

there are some days,
it's like when you paint,

some days you can't do anything wrong,

everything works for you.

and i think god was
having one of those days

when he made alaska,

some of the most gorgeous
scenery i've ever seen.

there we go. see?

just using the top corner of
this little two inch brush

to tap in all these little basic shapes.

there's not right, there's no wrong.

there, all you do is drop 'em in

and even here, you begin making out,

see there's all kind of
little things happening,

don't cover them up, leave 'em in there,

they become your friend.

shoot, i like these old big trees.

let's have another one over here.

something about like that.

there.

there we go, see?

just, once again, basic, very basic shape,

think like a tree, just think like a tree.

how's the tree's arms, how
do they hang off the sides?

look at trees, make friends with trees,

study 'em, study 'em,

go out in your yard and talk to a tree,

what the heck?

your neighbors might look at you like

you're a little strange, but
tell 'em you're an artist,

they'll understand that.

now, while we have this
little brush going here,

down here in the bottom in this black,

i want a little bluish color.

little bluish color,
i'm gonna take a little

of the prussian blue, just
a little prussian blue,

and just add a little blue
right in here, not much.

not much.

start at the bottom and
let it blend upward.

you're not looking for a lot of blue here,

just a little.

just a little.

about like that.

and maybe in our world

back in here, we'll take
a little paint thinner,

remember our golden rule,

thin paint will stick to a thick paint,

so i'm gonna take a little dark sienna,

least little touch of white in it.

okay, let's go up in here and maybe,

yep, you're right, here
and there the indication,

just the indication of a
little tree trunk stem,

whatever you wanna call it,

that lives right here, limbs and branches,

whatever.

but they live in these trees.

they live in there.

and take a little light color,

we said our light was
coming from the left,

so the left side, you can
make it a little lighter

if you want to.

see there?

now most of this we're gonna
end up covering up with leaves,

but some of it'll show
through and it'll be gorgeous

and people, when they
look at your painting,

shoot, they'll think you spent

half your life doing this painting, shh,

don't tell 'em no different.

alright, we'll go, let's
just keep using the same old

two inch brush, i left
the dirty color on it,

went right into yellow.

there's black and blue in this color,

so when you touch the yellow,

automatically, you're gonna get all these

gorgeous hues of green,
let's go up in here.

now, go slightly above the dark

and take this color and very gently,

just using the top corner of the brush,

that's all, little yellow,
ochre and indian yellow

here and there, just the top corner

begin tapping in all
these little basic shapes.

if you have trouble
making the paint stick,

add the least little
touch of paint thinner.

just a little paint thinner.

there.

see there? did you ever
think you could paint

all this detail just using the
corner of a two inch brush?

it looks like something you've painted

the barn with last week.

you can do that, you can do anything

that you believe you can do.

and i know you can do this,

so certainly if i know
it, you know it, too.

going to a little yellow
ochre, and i want to touch

a bright red once in awhile,
just to change the flavor.

ooh, i like that one, i like that one.

that's a nice one.

very nice color.

that'd warm up any room right there.

there, and begin working
on little individual trees

and bushes and things
that live all in here.

just think about all these little guys,

give 'em names if necessary.

give 'em names, this is
clyde, he lives right here.

like that, like that, see?

darker, darker, darker.

just let 'em get way
back in there, like that.

as i've mentioned frequently,
when you're painting,

i find it helps a great deal
to make up little stories

about your painting.

think about, think about this area,

would you like to live there?

maybe somebody does live there.

there we go, make up
little stories about it.

maybe there's a little
animal that lives here

that's your friend and
you know him very well.

talk about him, there.

something like that.

now, got another old big tree over here,

it needs a little bit, there.

we'll just put a little
in there, i'm gonna dip a

least little touch of paint thinner,

just to make it a little thinner.

there, see? goes on so much easier.

and you have to do that
every once in awhile.

especially if the paint's
the same consistency.

there, okay, darker, darker, darker

as it works down, darker and darker.

that helps create the
illusion of shadows and stuff

down in here.

maybe in here is some dark little bushes.

they just live in here,
wherever you want 'em.

there they are.

alright.

now sometimes you can take this brush,

get a little red on it,
and you can just sorta

take the corner of it and
move it back and forth, see?

just the corner, what a good shot, there.

see? just take it back and forth.

and now, when you go up here and touch it,

it'll make little pointy things.

see? they got little points on 'em

and it sorta, it sorta changes the flavor.

gives you a bush that's a
little different right in there.

okay, take a little bit
of the reddish col--

ooh, i like that one, little
firecracker right there.

little old firecracker.

there we go, and just very back and forth

between the greens and the yellows

and all these little colors.

but each one of these layers creates

a different plane in your painting

and that's what creates that
illusion of depth and distance.

there we go.

shoot, let's have some fun.

let's have some fun,
we can clean off a spot

to work here.

let's take black, little
bit of the prussian blue,

some brown, thalo green,
i like thalo green,

we'll make some evergreens.

there, a little crimson in
there too, what the heck?

it's our world, we can
do anything we want.

we wipe our knife off.

i just wipe the knife
on an old paper towel.

go back into our color with a fan brush.

load a lot of paint in the brush,

lotta paint, lotta paint.

maybe in our world there lives

an evergreen tree right there.

there he is, you knew he
was there, didn't you?

now when you're doing this, sometimes

to go over all the paint
that's in your mountain,

it gets a little difficult,
it don't wanna stick.

if that's the case, add
the least little touch

of paint thinner, just dip
the corner of your brush

into a little paint thinner,
then go back through your paint

and it'll the soften the
paint, make it thinner,

so it slides right on there.

enough of them little ones,
we need a big old tree.

and he lives right in there somewhere.

there, see you can go on over this,

sometimes you need to add a little thinner

'cause a thin paint will
stick to a thick paint.

and that way it'll go
right over the top of it

without any problem

and without all coming together.

we'll put one more in there

and then we'll quit over this way.

i just like to do evergreen trees,

i think they're one of the
most fun trees to paint.

and they're very easy.

let's put one on the other side.

artistically, it looks better
if you have an odd number.

now, i know nature doesn't know that rule

and you're gonna tell me
you looked out the other day

and saw and even number
of trees in your yard,

i know that's true,

but artistically, it does
look a little better.

but if you wanna have an even
number of trees in your world,

that's your business

and it's your tree and
your world and you do it

any way that you want.

alright, now let's take a little white,

little bit of van dyke and
dark sienna mixed in there.

and let's just put us a
indication here and there

little bit of tree trunk, it lives there,

i don't want a lot over here

just a little, just indications,
maybe even back in there

is a little.

wherever you think they should live.

we can take that same old
brush, go back through

'cause it has the tree color on him.

go back over some cad
yellow and yellow ochre,

little indian yeller, yellow.

lotta color, let's go back up in here.

our light's coming in from the left

so we wanna emphasize
the left side of the tree

a little more than the right.

there we go, and just begin
dropping in a few highlights,

don't overdo, you'll lose
all this gorgeous darkness

and evergreens are normally,

normally, i say, a little
bit darker than other trees.

there they go.

something about like that,
darker, darker, darker.

now, let's go into van dyke brown.

time to get crazy here.

maybe in our world there lives some dirt,

big rocks, stones, all
kinda things, right here.

that easy.

that easy.

there.

alright, maybe comes right on out in here.

we talk a little of that,
that was that brown and white

we had left over from the tree trunks.

we just pull something
out like that, like that.

now, we'll take a lighter brown and white

maybe that one was in shadow,

just sorta make up little things,

and here, this one here,
is a little bit stronger,

little bit more light hittin' that.

just let the knife barely
touch, bounce along there,

barely touching, barely, barely touching.

alright, take and just
grab it here and there

and sort of pull it down

and make it look like a big,
strong bank right there.

that easy.

our fan brush that has the
greens on it and stuff,

we just take it and
pop in, pushing upward,

pop in the indication,
little bushes and things

that live right out in here.

now, let's have some fun,

i'm gonna take a little bit of black,

put some paint thinner with it,

and make it very thin,
i want a thin paint.

little bit of black, put
some brown in there, too,

black and brown.

okay, but it's very thin,

it's got a lot of paint thinner in it.

now, i wanna take some
brown and some white,

little black in it, and
we'll make a lighter color

that's also very thin.

that's all there is to it, just put

a little paint thinner with it.

we'll take our little filbert brush.

we'll go right through the dark,

load both sides full of dark,

and i'm gonna go right down here,

pull only one side through the light.

and with that, in one stroke,

you can make all kinds
of little indications

of little rocks and stones that
live back in here like that.

now, little bit, and i say that again,

a little bit of titanium
white on the two inch brush,

i wanna keep this quite dark,

just touch and pull downward,

pull downward

a little bit.

just enough, just enough to show.

i want this water to be
very dark, mysterious water

so that liquid black comes in so great.

it makes wonderful,
wonderful effects like that.

little while, little thalo blue

and then we'll just take,
and just touch the canvas.

this is thick paint, normally
i use a thin, thin paint

to do water lines.

this one's much thicker,

all i'm doing is just touching,
just touch the canvas.

the canvas will take off what it wants,

give you back what's left,

just like a tax man does,

 just like he
does with my paycheck.

yeah, he just takes off what he wants

and what's left, it isn't much.

alright, back into our dark color.

that was mostly, we
had some prussian blue,

i think black, brown,
little sap green, crimson,

doesn't matter.

let's put a little projections
that comes out of this side.

and all i'm doing is
putting some dark color on

so our light will show.

something about like that.

we don't know where it goes,
don't know that we care.

i got another two inch
brush here that i was using

that has green on it and with that,

yeah, look, look, look,

we'll put in, just tapping,
follow the angles though,

follow angles, most important.

a little more of the
yellow ochre in that one,

just enough to change
the flavor a little bit.

there, see? put all these
little things in here

wherever you want 'em.

wherever you want 'em.

something about like that.

there we go.

and you can change angles and stuff

and all kinds of things will happen.

back to our blue and white on a knife.

and let's put a little water
line right around there.

that sorta just brings it all together,

keep it dark, though, very, very dark.

our filbert brush, i wanna
put a rock over there,

i like these little rocks,
they're the most fun to make.

bloop, bloop, bloop, one
stroke and they're in.

that's all there is to it.

shoot, i think with that, we're
about ready for a signature

on this one, take a little
red, little paint thinner.

we'll call this little painting finished.

hope you've enjoyed it,

it's a nice way to use the liquid black,

give you a lot of experience.

i think with that, we're
gonna call this one done.

and from all of us here,
i'd like to wish you

happy painting and god bless, my friend.





- hello, i'm bob ross and
i'd like to welcome you

to the 21st joy of painting series.

if this is your first time with us,

let me extend a personal invitation

for you to drag out your
little paint brushes

and some paints and paint
along with us each show.

or just drag up the old easy chair

and enjoy a relaxing half hour

as we play some of nature's
masterpieces on canvas.

and for those of you've
been with us for a while,

thank you very, very
much for inviting us back

for another series of painting shows.

tell you what, let's get right to it.

let's start today and have
'em run all the colors

across the screen that you
need to paint along with me.

and while they're doing
that, come on up here

and let me show you
what i've already done.

have my standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas,

but you use any size
that's convenient for you.

we just use this

because it sorta fits
the television screen.

the bottom of it i have
covered with a little bit

of black gesso.

and you can put it on with a sponge

or foam brush or just paper towel.

it doesn't matter, anything to cover it

and then let that dry.

then we've applied some transparent color

down here on the bottom of this.

and today i've used a little sap green

and van dyke brown mixed together.

and it's still wet.

the black gesso has dried

but the transparent color
on top here is still wet.

okay, and then the top we've just covered

with a little bit of liquid white,

and it just makes the canvas
nice and wet and slick

and it allows us to actually
blend color on the canvas

rather than working ourself
to death on the palette.

so i tell you what, let's just take off

and have some fun today.

let's start with this
little two inch brush here

and we'll go right into a small amount

of the phthalo blue.

and all we do is just
pull a little bit out

and then tap it into the bristles.

by tapping, and turn the
brush over, tap both sides.

see that assures a nice
even distribution of color

all the way through the bristles

and that's what we're looking for.

and it's easy to add more color,

but it's a son of a gun to take it away.

so start with a little bit of color.

you can always add more if you need it.

we'll go right up to the top of the canvas

and we'll start, we'll
just do some little xs,

little criss cross strokes.

and we'll work all the way across the top.

now the color is continually
mixing with the liquid white.

and it creates all those
beautiful variations that we want.

let me put a little more
color on the brush here.

there we go.

but start at the top and work down.

and that way our sky will
get progressively lighter

toward the horizon.

and that's exactly what we're looking for.

in a landscape you want things

to get lighter toward the horizon

and darker as they come
away from the horizon.

so by using the liquid white

and allowing the color to blend,

that effect happens automatically.

you really don't have to worry about it,

it just happens.

and that truly is the joy of painting.

there, we'll just work this right on down.

i thought today we'd start this series

with just a very basic little painting.

and if you've painted with us before

this'll be an easy one for ya.

if this is your first time,
then you can see one of the ways

this fantastic technique works.

okay, now we just take and very gently

go across the entire sky.

this just removes the brush strokes.

that's all we're doing.

okay, and that simple.

we have a happy little sky.

and that's all you have to do

to make a very, very basic little sky.

now let's build us a little mountain.

i like the mountains.

we'll take some black,
little prussian blue,

some alizarin crimson and
we just mix those together.

i'd even put a little
van dyke brown in there,

just to dull it down some.

pull the color out as
flat as you can get it

and go straight down with the knife,

cut across so you have
a little roll of paint.

and that little roll of paint should live

right on the edge of your knife,

right on the edge of the blade.

now then we have to make
our first major decision

in this painting.

where does our mountain live?

i think in my world it's
gonna live maybe right there.

it is now anyway.

all we're doing here is
just pushing that color

right into the fabric,
right into the canvas.

and this is pre-stretched canvas,

we do not recommend the canvas boards

'cause they have the tendency
to absorb the liquid white

and you end up with a dry
surface almost immediately.

maybe, maybe here, yeah, right there.

we'll have another little bump there.

just wherever you want 'em.

and painting is a very individual,

everybody will see nature
through different eyes

and everybody has their own idea

of what a mountain should
look like, or a tree.

all we wanna do here is show
you how to make these effects.

what you paint is totally up to you.

we just wanna show you how to paint.

just to get you, just to get you started.

there, now using a big brush
and very firm pressure,

i wanna pull this down.

the only thing we're
worried about right now

is this nice outside edge.

we could care less
what's happening in here.

but once again,

because we have the liquid
white on the canvas,

the color is blending with
that and as you can plainly see

automatically as it goes down

it gets lighter and lighter in value.

and once again, that
will happen automatically

when you have the liquid
white on the canvas.

and it's just an oil base,

white paint that allows
you to do all this.

you can just blend it right on down

and already that mountain looks like

it's almost sitting out there in the mist.

i tell you what, let's wash the old brush.

that's the fun part of this.

that's the fun part.

shake off the excess and just,

 just beat the devil out of it.

as i say, that's the
part that's the most fun.

there we go.

let's take some titanium white today.

and we'll reach up here and
i'll get a very small amount

of the dark sienna.

don't want much, just
a little dark sienna.

a little bit, maybe i'll even

put a touch of the bright red in there.

oh that's nice.

i just wanna flavor this a little.

just enough to flavor it a little bit.

now when you do yours,

you make the determination
how much you want.

let me wipe the knife here.

and we just wipe our knife
on a clean paper towel.

then we can cut off our
little roll of paint again,

so it's right on the edge of the knife.

and let's go up in here, no
pressure, no pressure touch.

and let that knife just
float, let it float,

let it float right down
the side of the mountain.

think about where light would strike.

okay let's go right in here.

zoom, gotta make those little noises

or it doesn't work right.

there.

just pull.

see there how easy that is though?

and you can change it to
any color that you wanted,

any color that you wanted.

sometimes i like to do
this with a grey color

that looks like stones and rocks and,

depends on where you live.

maybe in your world you
don't want a mountain.

then you can paint this scene
and it'll be very beautiful

without a mountain.

it's up to you.

it's really up to you.

as we mentioned earlier, painting is,

is as individual as people are.

there.

now then, we have to start thinking about

little things maybe, in my world,

i think there's a little light
gonna strike right there.

so we'll put a little
touch of light there.

and we'll take some white,

we'll use a little bit of
that mountain color with it.

and a little bit of phthalo
blue with it, what the heck.

maybe a little more blue there.

and with that we'll make
us a nice shadow color.

now this shadow color should
be lighter than the base color

that you put on your mountain.

but certainly darker than your highlights.

so somewhere in between.

you have to reach a happy medium.

once again our little of paint, okay?

let's go up here.

now if this one's gonna
be the farthest away,

we'll do this little rascal first,

put a little bit of shadow right there.

all there is to it.

now watch, watch.

come distinctly through

and look how it pushed
that little devil back.

bet you didn't realize
you had that much power.

but on this piece of canvas you have

total and complete power here.

you can do anything that you wanna do.

you can move mountains, rivers, trees.

you can determine what your world is like.

there's tremendous amount
of freedom on this canvas.

and that's what makes it fun.

that's what makes it fun.

now then, and you can come back in here,

see this line is very straight.

now we can come back in here

and we can put all kinds
of little ridges and bumps

and little places where the mountain goat

would have to live up here.

he's gotta have a little home too.

we'll just let that run right on down.

okay, but each one of
these little projections

needs a little shadow.

needs a little shadow
or it just won't play.

it'll go hide.

see how that little shadow
just brought it right out?

watch though, maybe it
goes right over here.

i don't know.

don't know, it's up to you.

you have to make these big decisions.

there.

but notice the angles here.

all the highlights are
going in one basic angle.

all the shadows are
going in one basic angle.

they vary a little, but overall,

overall they're going in the same angle.

'cause if light's coming through here,

it's only gonna strike on a given angle.

now with a good clean, dry brush

we can tap the base of this a little

and create the indication of mist

that lives right down at the bottom

of this big ole mountain here.

lift gently upward, upward,

following the angles in the mountain.

and that removes the little tap marks

and brings it all together.

over here go in this direction.

tap a little and blend.

there.

alright, now maybe we'll
get a little crazy today.

i like to do that.

let's take, i'll use a
little of the mountain color

and we'll go right into some yellow,

i got a little cad yellow
here, a little yellow ochre,

we'll just use the same
old two inch brush.

doesn't matter, maybe a little touch

of the sap green here and there.

maybe in our world there
lives some little trees

that sorta grow right up
the side of this mountain.

and to do that all you have
to do is take the big brush

and tap, but most, most important here,

we need to follow these angles.

need to follow these angles.

if you don't, it just
absolutely won't look right.

vary the colors between darker
green and lighter green.

back and forth a little.

just a little, maybe sort of determine

where you think a little
tree would live right here.

and how far up the mountain it would grow

before you reach the tree line.

or, the place where it gets too cold

and too high for trees to live.

there.

if you've painted with me before

you know i lived in alaska
for, well over a dozen years.

and i just absolutely fell in love

with the fantastic scenery that's there.

god was having a good
day when he made alaska.

it is gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

there we go.

but these kinda sights
are pretty common there.

now we'll take a clean, dry one inch brush

and very lightly, little short strokes.

i wanna grab that and lift upward.

just lift it upward, upward, upward.

and sorta let it blend together a little.

and you just sorta work
back and forth here.

but gently, gently lifting upward.

always going upward.

think about the little trees,

even though they're
going at an angle here,

they would still grow straight up.

so keep these lines going straight up.

sometimes the tendency,
the mountain go this way

to make your trees like that.

and it'll look like the big
giant sneezed or something

and blew 'em all over.

we don't want that.

and you can even touch a little
dark color here and there.

and just pull up the indication

of some that are a little darker.

you can continually
play this back and forth

between the darker greens
and lighter greens.

and it's a nice way of making
very effective little trees

that are growing up the
side of this mountain.

there.

okay, shoot that's so much fun.

i tell you what, wash the old brush again.

i just look for reasons to wash the brush.



alright, we're in business again here.

let's take, let's get crazy.

let's have some fun.

we'll take some prussian blue,

some van dyke brown, some midnight black,

maybe even a little sap green.

we'll just mix all those together.

just mix 'em together,

make a big ole pile of dark color here.

it should look black, should look black.

okay, now then, tell you what,

let me wipe the ole knife off.

fact, we'll get a, let's get a fan brush.

shoot, that's fun.

i'm gonna load the fan brush
full of this dark color,

both sides, a lot of color.

let's go right up in here.

maybe in our world there's a little,

maybe there's a little
foothill that lives right here.

tell you what i'm gonna do,

i'm gonna add a little,

little bit of white to that,

i wanna lighten it just a little,

oh that's much better.

went a little bit lighter.

there.

but there's some little footy
hills that live right here.

some evergreen trees are growing on it.

and they're much closer to us.

much closer to us.

so they're darker, they're much darker

than this background back here.

just tap 'em down with the fan brush.

this is one of the neatest ways
that i've ever come up with

of making the illusion
of a lot of little trees

that live far away.

there we go.

and you determine how many
and where and all that.

there we go.

now then,

we can take a clean, dry two inch brush

and i'm just gonna tap
the base here a little.

i wanna create a little bit of mist

at the bottom of these trees.

and this tapping will cause

the liquid white to come through.

and a little bit of that color will show.

lift upward, just to
take out the tap marks

and bring it all together.

see there?

there we go, there we are.

now then,

maybe, maybe in our world,

we'll just use that same old fan brush,

it's working so well
here, let's keep going.

load a lot of the pure dark color on it.

let's go right up here.

maybe there lives a happy little
evergreen tree right there.

we just use the corner of the brush.

and just go back and forth, see there.

that easy.

and let's give him a few friends.

we don't want him to get lonely back here.

my gosh, with a scene like
he's got to look at here,

he'd have to invite all of his
friends over to see it too.

this is just, this is just too nice

for him to keep for himself.

there's a little one.

put the little guy right
up here in the front row

so he can see all of this too maybe.

there we go.

there we go.

notice how these little
misty areas make those trees

really stand out.

that's why they're so important.

that's your separator,
that's your good friend.

that's your good friend, take care of him.

take care of him.

and you put as many or as few
as you want in your world.

one thing that we're trying to do here,

is just to teach you a method.

we're really not trying
to teach you to copy.

that's the reason we have no patterns

or we don't do any tracings on the canvas.

we wanna teach you freedom
with this technique.

and turn you loose on the world.

just absolutely turn
you loose on the world.

because once you know the technique,

you can do anything.

take a little blue, a
little tiny bit of blue

and white and a little
bit of the dark sienna.

pull it out flat and get a
least little roll of paint

right out here on the edge of the knife.

and let's just make the
indication here and there

of a little tree trunk.

right in there.

or right, we don't want many,

'cause you wouldn't see all of 'em.

oh you're just gonna see
a little here and there.

and you can just,

'cause you've picked up
some paint on your knife

you can just make the indication

of some little sticks and
twigs and all kinds of things

that are just projecting out of that.

because in the woods, in the
forest, they're always there.

now then, i have several
fan brushes going.

let me just grab another one here.

let's put some highlights on that.

we'll take a little,
little bit of the color

we made the trees out of,
'cause it has blue in it.

and mix it with some cad yellow

and a little yellow ochre
and a little indian yellow,

what the heck.

and we'll make us a nice green.

if you want it darker,

add a little more of that tree
color to it and instantly,

because it has blue and black in it,

see, it gets darker.

that easy.

let the paint work for you.

let's go up here.

now then our light's coming from the right

because our mountain tells us that.

so we wanna place more emphasis

on the right side of the
tree than on the left.

then we just put the
indication of some highlights

that are showing through on these trees.

now sometimes, sometimes
this gets feeling good.

and you cover up all the dark.

we don't wanna do that.

if we lose all that nice dark

then our tree becomes flat.

it's that darkness that's deep in the tree

that creates the illusion of shadows

and makes depth in the tree.

otherwise it'll be a
very flat, little tree.

we don't want that, we
don't want any flat trees.

we want trees that, the son
of a guns have personalities.

they're like people, each one's different.

some are tall, some are short.

some are heavy, some are thin.

they're like people.

i mean this painting can
really and truly become

a world on its own.

you can find anything
that you want in here.

you can find peace, you can
find calm times, anything.

it's right here.

shoot, let me get off my soap box here

and find a brush and let's get crazy.

let's make a, let's make a
big evergreen right there.

and for that, i'm gonna, tell you what,

i'm gonna pick up the old oval brush here.

we'll go right into that same tree color.

now this is the oval brush.

the end of it, let me hold
it up here so you can see.

the end of it's sorta round.

and it's easy to distinguish,
'cause it has a black handle.

and the rest of 'em have white handles.

easy to tell the difference.

okay pull it like that til it
comes to a nice, sharp edge.

let's go up here.

make a decision.

maybe our big tree, we're gonna have one

that's gonna live right there.

we start out by just making a little line.

that sorta gives you a guide.

take just the end of the brush.

now this is gonna be one
of them big evergreen trees

that sorta saggy.

the limbs hang over.

i like this brush for
making these kinda trees.

see how the limbs hang.

oh, i like that.

but you can do this with a one inch brush

and have straight limbs.

you can do it with a fan brush.

i use a fan brush very often.

or you can do it with a two inch brush.

it all works very well,

but if you want these hangy
down looking limbs like this,

i find it much better
to use this oval brush.

there.

now then all we're doing here

is just placing in some
very basic little shapes.

just think about the arms on this tree

that live out here.

where you want 'em.

there.

maybe this old tree lives, i don't know,

somewhere down in here, we don't care.

i don't know, that was fun.

 i like making
trees with that oval brush.

i tell you what, let's make another one.

let's make another one.

maybe our other tree, maybe
we'll have one right there.

and we start out the same way,

just make a little line.

and, back and forth, back and forth.

just sorta let that rascal
come right outta that brush.

it lives in there.

he lives in there.

ole tree now sometimes
they'll hide in there,

you have to sorta force 'em out.

but isn't that a fantastic way

of making some very beautiful evergreens?

now, shoot, you know me.

i think everybody needs a friend.

so we're gonna give him one right here.

right there.

there, see, there he comes.

and we're not concerned in this area.

that's all so dark, we'll
separate all that with highlights,

all that with highlights.

let's take a little bit of that
color we had for our trunk,

and we'll just touch with the knife.

and just once again, we're
not gonna see much of it.

all we wanna do here,

is just show a little,
just here and there.

just wherever you think it should show.

like that.

i think i'll was the
ole oval brush out here.

let's have some fun with
some highlight colors.

okay now then for
highlights i'm gonna take

a little of that tree color
and mix it with the cad yellow.

and the yellow ochre and a
little of the indian yellow.

but mix all these colors on the brush

so you have a multitude of
things happening on the brush.

you don't end up with one dead ole color.

alright, now then think about your light.

it's coming from the right.

now we can go up in here

and just begin putting in the indication

of some beautiful highlights

that live right here on this tree.

see 'em?

there they are.

there.

let's just put some in.

but this is where you make
all those old hangy down limbs

and we're going straight in
with the brush, straight in.

and just touching.

just touching, letting those
top part of the bristles,

just the top part of the bristles touch.

right there, see there?

now then, let's go over
on the other side here.

and do the same thing for him.

if we left him out, shoot
he'd probably be angry.

probably be angry.

we don't want that, we want
happy trees in our paintings.

 i get some letters some times,

people say everything
in your world is happy.

and that's true.

we try to keep everything happy in here.

shoot, if you want bad
stuff, watch the news.

in this world, we only
have pleasant things.

there.

now then, sometimes it's fun.

i'll just dip this into a
little bit of the liquid clear.

and i want a real thin
color, much lighter,

but i use the clear to thin it.

and then it'll, it's very thin paint now.

you can go back up here and pick out

where you think light would
really zing through here.

and just put on a few sparklers.

don't over do this.

don't over do.

'cause it gets good.

just here and there.

but that clear thins the paint.

if you've painted with me before

you know our golden rule here

is a thin paint will
stick to a thick paint.

we use very firm paint until
we get to the highlights.

and maybe just a few over in here,

i don't want too many on this tree.

just a few, there.

alright, we're alright there.

let's have some fun.

now we have a transparent color here.

this was sap green and a
little bit of van dyke brown,

just to dull it.

i'm gonna take pure
white, just titanium white

on the two inch brush.

you have to make a big decision,

where is your water?

i want some water in here.

touch this and pull it straight down.

it's important that it
comes straight down.

then that sap green and van dyke brown,

they'll make some
beautiful, beautiful colors.

and it's fun to prepare this
canvas when nobody's looking

and when you do this,

especially if you're painting for someone,

they think it's magic.

now we go straight across.

and that'll create the illusion of water.

that easy.

now take a one inch brush, put
a little liquid white on it

and go right through some of that color.

just a nice green color.

and let's back in here, put the indication

of just a happy little bush
or two that lives right here,

right on the edge of the water.

something like that.

little van dyke brown, a little
dark sienna mixed together.

and we can put the indication
of some land back in there.

see there?

that easy.

a little bit of brown and white,

put a little highlight on it.

shoot, we're in business.

a little bit more of that color.

maybe there's a shoo, looky there.

little bank lives out here too, see,

just sorta let that go,
barely, barely touching though.

and a little bit on the other side.

see, we can put another bank over here.

in your world, you make these decisions,

decide where all these little things live.

take a little touch of the
liquid white on the knife.

and we'll just cut in a little water line.

and this separates, just separates.

it's just straight liquid white.

a few little ripples here and there.

shoot we 'bout have a finished painting.

i think that, i think
we'll call that one done.

but this is a good example of
how easy this technique is.

so i look forward to seeing
you in the next show.

and until then, happy
painting, god bless my friend.



welcome back glad you could join me

today you know they say that time really

goes by when you're having fun and here

we find ourselves on our last show of

this series so i thought today you know

since i lived in alaska so long i'd do a

special alaskan painting so if you come

on up here to canvas i'll tell you what

we've already done now i've taken a

black canvas as you can see now we

painted this with just a flat black

acrylic paint allow that to dry and then

on top of that i've put all different

kinds of transparent colors i've put

some right and here's some alizarin

crimson over in here some phthalo green

they little blue and green mixed all

over the canvas so it's completely

covered with a thick paint so it's all

ready to go so let's have them

graphically run all the colors across

the screen that you need to paint this

project with me and i think today we'll

do some northern lights so come on up

here unless let's get started i want to

use the old fan brush today so probably

one of the best ways to do this is sort

of take and you can just on this black

canvas you can draw in some basic shapes

and if you've never seen the northern

lights a lot of times they're in what

they call curtains or just layers now if

in your part of the country there's no

such thing as northern lights you can do

the same scene leave the lights out and

maybe put a little moon in this guy and

it'll be just as effective but once

again for my friends in alaska today i

want to do a northern lights picture

start with the old fan brush right into

titanium white now we already have all

those beautiful colors on the canvas so

all we need is white does go up here now

decide where these curtains or these

lights are gonna be and just begin

tapping see all i'm doing is just

tapping and tapping the color in and

make your basic shapes just very basic

shapes

and a little more paint where you want

to be a little brighter we have one

coming right across here and i'm just

tapping titanium white on there

sometimes there's little ridges and they

put balance around it that counts

just right on the round right down

around it we will have three layers of

lights in this painting and you can have

as many as you want or as few as you

want it's up to you up to you now then

this is where the fun starts

let's take a one inch brush and i'm

gonna begin grabbing this and lifting it

upward just grab it and pop it just pop

it up already you can see it begin

picking up some of the different colors

and here like so this one johnny horton

wrote a beautiful song but northern

lights boy didn't lights were running

wild in the land of the midnight sun and

i lived there for over a dozen years and

that has to be that has to be one of the

prettiest countries in the world god was

really having a good day when he made

alaska now then i'm gonna take the 2

inch brush and go all the way through

this and lift up all the way through

follow the same angles all the way look

at that there are you going you can pull

these as high as you want them and some

parts of the country they don't see a

lot of color in northern lights they see

maybe only white's or yellows and you

can do yours at play where i lived right

outside of fairbanks in a little town

called north pole

sometimes we would see lights in every

color in the rainbow

makes it a little more interesting so i

figured if i did a bunch of colors you

would find your color too here somewhere

okay you see now right in here this is

where the crimson was you have sort of a

lavender feel in here and blue and here

over here there's a little phthalo green

mixing with if they low blue make some

beautiful beautiful colors in the sky

let's wash the old brush give it a shake

this beat the devil out of it

and no painting of alaska would be

complete without an almighty mountain

take a little bit of black put a little

brown in there very dark pull it out

flat cut across get that little roll of

paint right on the edge of the knife

okay let's go up here you have to make

the big decision where's your mountain

to live right there takes a very little

paint because the canvases are just

black put little bumps and hills and

valleys whatever you want in your

mountain

she just drop it in there like so and

scrape off all the excess paint you

really really can't scrape too hard then

go take a large brush grab it and pull

this just basically removes excess paint

the more of this paint that you can get

off but easier the next layer is

distinct let's take off all of it you

can get off this is also an excellent

way using brush strokes to begin letting

out your highlights and shadows see see

how you can pull all kinds of effects

there maybe you want to have and you're

not committed you can just keep changing

this and playing with it maybe you want

a little shadow you can see there that's

that easy to find out how your

highlights and shadows were looking

there pull it through or you just keep

going

spend all day just play in there

okay now then let's use our old knife

i'm going through the titanium white and

a little bit of blue just a small amount

of blue there just just enough to ten it

okay pull it out from very flat as flat

as you can get it get tough with it and

come across get that a little roll of

paint right over the edge of the knife

just go back up here now then let's have

some snow just coming right down the

side of this moment wherever you want it

to go no pressure no pressure at all

just let it flow you want that paint to

break all these little holes listen

there you go see and you can wiggle that

knife and cause all kinds of little

effects to happen let it go can you

write up here on the top we want a

little bit of snow right up here there

it comes right damn

maybe joins together you have to make

big decisions here maybe there's some

light striking right over here on that

little ridge let's begin with our

shadows for the shadows gonna take blue

and white mix it together maybe we'll

make it a little bit lighter still a

little dark for what i want

that's much better cut across it our

little world of pain again okay

now then no pressure no pressure just

let it barely caress the canvas yeah

just begin elating of all kinds of

little things anywhere you want a little

ridge just drop it in this is your

painting dear world you can do anything

that you

here little bit right back here see now

we can take this one

and pull it distinctly through and it

pushes that one right back hmmm

do you know you had that kind of power

could you push a mountains around why

did i go home only thing push around the

chair but here i can push around to

anything from the mountains and trees

and rivers there we go put a happy

little pete freddy's hair now we're

using a very firm paint here we want

this point to be as firm as possible

okay now see this little point here it

needs to have its own private shadow it

doesn't have its own check and it won't

stand out like an individual and you can

just bounce it back and forth here and

pull a chute look at there baby baby

there's another one there's right there

as many or as few as you want in your

world is your creation but each one of

them see here now once again right here

we need to have another shadow there we

go all the time this is mixing with that

beautiful color this underneath it

allows all kinds of things to happen you

know let's take a clean dry two inch

brush and i'm going to gently gently tap

following the angles in the mountain

always follow your ankles and tap more

down here at the base then you do up

here up here you just barely want to

whisper it down at the bottom you want

to tap it a little bit harder if you

would get into collecting some paint on

your brush just take beat the devil out

of it and that'll remove the excess

picking right off your brush without

going through a lot of cleaning

yeah soph has to get into them over here

if you follow these angles always pay

attention to the angles in your mouth

and that's what you're looking for

they're very gently lift upward this

takes out all those little tap marks

softens balloons creates the illusion of

mist just like so fantastic okay yeah we

can play some more

that's fine as a fan brush i think we'll

just go right into this mixture we had

before we made the mountain with it it

was black they look blue little vendek

brown just mix them on the brush load

that brush full of paint look at all the

paint's in there just go back up here

maybe there's some happy little trees

live back here huh these are far away

and all we're looking for it's just

little indications a little evergreens

that are far back in the distance

get a little more paint so you're using

the top part of that brush and just tap

downward that's all there is to it

hey you don't want to kill all this

misty area you kill this mist it's right

up here all little happened is these

trees will run right into the mountain

you wanted to stay separated so don't

kill you misty area save them they're

precious the good friends right here in

this mountain everything they do your

best friends so cherish him so now if

you get these two far apart they're

gonna begin looking like fence post so

if you if your little evergreens that

are far in the distance begin looking

like fence post chances are you just

don't have enough i had a few more and

see if it didn't doesn't help take care

of that little problem not easy we get

some happy little evergreen definitely

you back here in the distance all the

way across yeah then we can take another

fan brush you know i have i have several

of them going here so i don't have to

don't have to continually wash him we

take a little blue and white this was

just a little the shadow color is left

over let's go up here i want to just pop

in some indication of some happy little

tree trunks just on the bottom touch it

pull it straight up

touch pull straight up very lightly very

just enough to create a little little

light area down here at the base of

these trees just makes them a little

prettier so you're playing light against

dark dark against light continually

potato that's what painting is all about

baby hey we back here in the distance we

can start playing with a little detail

we'll take that same old black color

just a lot of paint in the brush just

black blue a lot of paint look at there

that the brushes are really full okay

let's go right up in here yeah we just

pop in a few little little bushes don't

want to kill all the little little tree

trunk areas that you made there you see

that little light area now is your

separator to divider just like so yeah

then i'll go back to this fan brushes

get mainly white on it can you take what

i'm gonna do and when i have it the

least little touch of the liquid white

to it to make it a little thinner just

go back up here nothing i want some i

want some bright things happening here

so i'm gonna take this and begin pushing

upward accrete just some happy little

grassy areas back here allow it to mix

with that color it's underneath all the

blues and blacks crates all kinds of

little things there we go maybe comes

right along in there whatever you want

maybe there's one out there will have

this will go up just sort of make a

decision let it happen yeah then let's

take a 2 inch brush and i'm just gonna

tap it into a little of the titanium

white just just gently tap it you see

okay let's go up here yeah i want a

happy little reflection to live right

underneath here oh you need his wife

because the color is already on the

canvas let's pull it straight down

straight down and start where you want

it to be the brightest and then work

outward in both directions and

automatically it'll get darker as it

works away from that area now with a

clean brush pull it down firmly like so

let's pull it straight down and then go

lightly across look at that

i don't take a little bit of liquid

quite and a little bit of titanium white

and mix it together pull it out flap

let's get a little roll of paint on the

knife tiny to the roll there it is and

let's go up here and just put the

indication of a little snow it's laying

right along the base of it and just

barely touching the canvas just barely

touching it allow it to mix with that

covers underneath don't fight these i

don't know just let them happen

there we are okay

that maybe tell you what let's play a

little the blue in the black on the fan

brush maybe right here an evergreen

that's a little bigger he's a little

touch closer i'm gonna drop him in right

there just like that and he lives right

out there but give him a little friend

we don't even meet lonely

he's just sitting right here watching

the northern lights or aurora borealis

whatever you want to call it easier to

take northern lights i'm gonna take a

little touch of that blue and white

mixture loaded on the fan brush and come

right along here i just put the

indication of a few little highlights

these trees are far away i don't want

too many if you get too many just take

your dark paint go right back over me

leaned it or right up all right all

right

now then let's have some fun let's put

in some bigger trees same old color just

use the blue and black mix it well

okay let's go right up here maybe yep i

see a big tree that there's right there

start with just the corner of the fan

brush work it back and forth back and

forth

and as you work down the tree add more

and more pressure down here you're

getting tough oh you're really taking

out all your frustrations down here

banging there's another tree here see

nothing everything's like people i've

known so many fantastic friends with

painting i think everything's got to

have friends trees and bushes and

everything needs friends everybody needs

a friend i'm going on the other side

over here let's get crazy i want one

that goes way up and goes all the way

through this northern light now there's

as many different ways to paint northern

lights as there are painters this is

just one interpretation and this is what

they look like to me who are they

it really makes a beautiful painting and

these black canvases when you change the

light source the painting changes you

put this under three different lights

and you'd almost you'd almost believe

you had three different paintings it

changes that much it's almost

unbelievable

and at home try these black canvases

with any transparent color i've got

letters that have asked me how do i tell

what color is transparent there's a very

very simple test fact i tell you why the

cameras right there i'll show you take a

color like blue bring the camera right

in here so we can see see if you take

this blue and rub it on here that still

looks black that color is transparent

and then let's take a color okay

let's use bright red that's a very

opaque color now when you put it there

whoo see what happens that color is not

transparent

it will not do for what we're trying to

do here that's a good test of course now

we got a red spot on the canvas hey

paint another tree tree he's cover up a

multitude of sins

we'll have another one yeah okay we'll

get a one-inch brush we'll use it for a

little bit take a same color the blue

into black we'll grab a little bit of

this lighter color and put it in there

pull that brush in one direction the

loaded full of paint so very dark blue

james go ahead up here now maybe we're

gonna have some happy little

snow-covered bushes so all we're doing

it's just beginning to lay in some of

the very basic shapes you're not looking

for detail yet only very basic shapes

very basic okay let's go right over in

here maybe there's a happy bush yep

that's right tear comes right now or

just wherever you want wherever you want

can have as many or as few just just let

your imagination take you

if you've never been to alaska you know

where to go see it it's almost unreal i

was born and raised in florida i was

almost 20 years old before i ever saw

snow and my favorite uncle uncle sam he

sent me up there in january thought that

would be funny and it was funny i i got

off the plane the first thing i did was

stepped on the ice and fell on my bottom

because i didn't know how to walk on ice

i'm taking some liquid white and going

right into titanium hoyt pull it in one

direction i'm gonna put a little tiny

bit of blue in it one direction look at

all the painters on that brush it's a

really full okay let's go up there now

then you begin picking out or all these

little bushes live and just barely touch

give it a little push and create all

these little snow-covered bushes and

alaska they have ice fog and ice fog

occurs normally when it's about 30 below

or colder and it covers everything

everything with frost it is so beautiful

trees look like they're in full foliage

it's so beautiful in the light place

through it and these all these little

ice-covered frosty things they act like

prisms and they break up the light and

you see all colors in the trees and the

dead of winter you can see just you have

to go see it i can't can't explain it

all to you

so pretty but there's a nice bush just

grows right out of that brush we'll put

another one right there there they go

let's drop them in just half the little

bushes happy little bushes there well

with the completion of this painting

this will enda at the eighth joy of

painting series it's hard for me to

believe it we have over a hundred shows

now over a hundred shows hmm taking a

little blue here put a little highlight

on these trees

i really hope you've got to see all the

shows if there's any of them that you've

missed you'd like to see them give your

station to call i don't know i don't

know what you want to see and when they

need some help give them a hand there we

are let's go over to this tree told him

to be left out

just hearing their don't kill all the

dark contrast that's what makes it

pretty and you know me i gotta have a

little cabin in here so maybe with all

this paint i have on here i'm gonna

scrape out just the basic shape to get

rid of that loose paint it's also a good

way to layout you your initial cabin

shape start with a little bit of vendek

brown and i'll mix some dark sienna

right in that i've just mix them

together hold it across a little friend

on that cabin here you know and as we're

winding down this series i'd like to

take just a minute and thank the people

here at the television station we have

one of the finest crews in the country

and they they make some of these

beautiful television shows and you never

see them you may never they never get a

thank you if it wasn't for them they

wouldn't there wouldn't be any show a

little bit of brown and white here just

put some highlight on him give him a

little taller yeah tell you why

let's put some snow up here on his roof

just like so and it gives us a quick

little cabin we can just bring some snow

right down mike landess see how easy it

is put some snow over here on the other

side the roof we don't want that one to

be left out but that wherever you want

it okay

maybe sounds coming there just like

see and pay attention to your angles

when you're playing the snowing angles

are very important very important put

all kinds of little snow things here

okay let's go back in here pick up some

of the liquid point go right into my

titanium height owed to brush for and

this pop a few more little bushes right

in working layers completing the most

distant part of your painting first and

working forward just like so see little

bushy things over in here and we're on

the verge of having a completed painting

take the knife scratch - these two twigs

show and this one's about done once

again i'd like to thank you for being

with me during this eight joy of

painting series we have the ninth series

under production already so we'll see

you again from all of us here happy

painting

[music]

- hello, here we are again, ready to go.

hope you have the easel set up

and your almighty palette ready,

we'll paint a fantastic
little picture together.

i'm gonna have them quickly
run across the screen here

all the colors that we
have on the palette,

so if you haven't caught those
in one of the previous shows,

you can pick up all the
colors that we're using.

i thought today we'd do a very
quick happy little waterfall.

last week if you were
with us we did a waterfall

that was way off in the distance,

this time i think we'll do one
that's a little bit closer.

so i'm gonna start today

with a little tiny bit of thalo blue,

and i'll mix a little
van dyke brown with it,

and we'll just throw in
a quick little sky here,

something about like so.

and, while i have the blue on the brush,

i'll go right into a
little bit of thalo green,

and we'll put some water
in here, there we are,

just to give us some nice
little water indications.

ok, now, let's wash the brush real quick,

and we'll move right along.

ok, now we'll go into a tiny
bit of alizarin crimson,

let's just warm this up a little,

we'll put just a tiny bit
of crimson right here.

a little crimson, we don't
want to set the sky on fire,

just want to give it a nice, warm glow.

a little bit into the water.

there.

now let's bring all this together.

just using little criss-cross
strokes, back and forth,

sort of like you're making x's.

ok.

just very gently bring that together

so it's nice and evenly blended.

ok, let's take and put a,

let's put a little mountain
way in the background,

i use a little bit of
prussian blue, van dyke brown,

a touch of crimson.

we'll have a little mountains

way back in the distance back here.

something like so.

just a little small one.

now with the large brush,
i'm just gonna take

and pull that down, so it
blends it out on the bottom.

there we are.

we just want this mountain
to literally just disappear,

right at the bottom there.

ok, we'll take a little bit of white,

and i'm gonna put the least,

least little amount of permanent red in,

just to put a little warm
glow on the mountain.

tiny, tiny bit of permanent
red, it's very, very strong.

ok, let's run a little highlight,
right down through here.

don't want these to be too
bright, they wanna be far away.

very soft.

maybe there's a little highlight
striking right in here.

and right down this ridge.

for the shadow's side

we'll take a little
prussian blue and white.

there we go.

and, just drop some happy
little shadows in here.

and let's just let this one

wander around and play here a little.

let your heart take you
wherever you wanna go.

maybe there's another
little peak right there.

each highlight beats
its own private shadow,

so just give him a shadow,
so he stands apart.

ok, with a clean, dry brush now,

i'm just gonna tap the bottom of this,

just to create some mist.

over here we'll follow these
angles, then lift upward.

want this one to be very
soft, very far away.

ok, now let's take a little
bit of prussian blue,

van dyke brown, a little,
tiny bit of sap green,

we just mix it on the brush,
put a little white with it.

let's make a happy little
foothill, comes running down here,

there he is,

just let him wander
down here and have fun.

all we're doing is tapping the canvas.

now you can take and lift gently upward

to make it look like little trees,

way, way, way back in the distance there.

there we are.

now then,

maybe, let's do another
one, that was a lot of fun.

we'll take some blue and
brown, sap green again,

this one we want to be
a little bit darker,

because it's closer,

and we'll just have one run
right down through here.

alright.

it creates a lot of
depth in your painting,

and we can just take the
bottom of it and pull down,

and create our reflections.

gently lift upward, make
it look like little trees.

there we are.

just make all kinds of
little projections back here.

now, very gently i'm
gonna just wipe across,

to turn it into reflections.

ok, we'll take a little
bit of magic white,

and make a little waterline here.

this is just straight magic white,

remember our golden rule here,

a thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

so this is very thin, so it
will stick right on there.

ok, let's dull that one
a little bit, too bright.

and a little bit right out here.

now we could take a fan brush
using the same dark colors,

blue, brown, a little sap green,

and we could just drop a few
little indications of trees

back here, maybe these
are a little closer,

just like so.

don't want to get too much detail yet.

let's darken this one up, it's closer.

then, with just a little
tiny bit of yellow,

on the brush here, i'm just
gonna put a little highlight

so it looks like this is
beginning to get close enough

that we can see things, just
here and there, very little.

ok, that gives us a nice
background for a little waterfall.

now.

let's take the large brush,
put some prussian blue on it,

and a little van dyke brown,

and here we need to figure out

where the waterfall's gonna be,

have to make almighty decisions
when you're the creator.

and let's just say it's right here.

pull straight down, all we're
doing is applying some darks

so our light color will show on top.

and, let's throw some down here.

ok, clean the brush, and
we'll be ready to go here.

and we'll use the fan brush,

and take a little, tiny
bit of the magic white,

and add to firm white,

thin paint will stick to a thick paint,

so i've thinned it just a little bit here.

and we'll put some little
ripples in the water.

just touch the canvas.

now, to make the waterfall

pull the brush straight,

and let it fall, pshoo,

that's all there there
is to it, straight, fall.

and it'll pay you to
wipe the brush in between

because you're gonna pick up
a little bit of that blue.

tchoo.

just pull it over, let it fall.

that's why they call them waterfalls.

ok, let's go over here, pull
it over, and let it fall.

over, and it falls.

wipe some of that blue off
the brush, over, and fall.

and that's how easy it is
to make a little waterfall.

now with a little more of the magic,

a little more titanium white,

we can begin letting it hit and splashing,

have all kinds of little
fun things happen down here.

ok now, we need to determine

what's gonna contain this water,

so let's take van dyke brown,
just straight van dyke brown,

and we'll begin building some little,

some little cliffs and rocks,

something's gotta contain this,

be sure your rocks are
higher than the waterfall.

one thing that you have to remember,

water's probably the
laziest thing in nature,

it will not climb a rock

just so it can fall and be pretty for you.

it'd be nice if it would,
but it won't do it.

alright, let's just fill this in

with a lot of van dyke brown.

and, over here, let's come
right along like this,

let this big old stone just play there.

a lot of paint.

just like so.

now, we wanna makes these
stones look flat on top,

so i'll take a little burnt umber,

mix it with the van dyke brown,

maybe just a little
touch of yellow into it.

there we go.

now, wanna try to make
this look flat on top,

so this, when it comes
across, needs to be like so,

to keep it flat,

across here.

just let it go.

say it, van dyke, burnt umber, yellow.

let's have this one just
sort of come around, there.

ok.

now, angles, most important thing here,

bring these angles down.

a little bit of light color,
just a tiny, tiny bit,

probably the biggest mistake made

is putting too much highlight under here,

and you lose that beautiful darkness.

just enough to create a
little illusion of rocks here.

ok, little tiny bit over here,

and you can do this, like
so every once in a while,

just to break it up a little.

there we are.

angles so, most, most important.

now let's play with the water a little,

maybe it comes up in here and
splashes and has fun, tchoo.

little more of the magic white,

be sure your paint's a little bit thinner

than what's on the canvas already.

i'm having so much fun with rocks,

think i'll build another
little happy stone

that comes right out through here.

just using the van dyke brown.

and a little bit of our highlight color.

just let that work and play.

little pull downward.

ok, let's take a little
bit of the water over here,

and, i'm going crazy with stones today,

let's just bring something down like that,

maybe there's a big stone
right here in the front.

remember this is your world,

so anywhere you want a stone,
that's where it should be.

there we go, we'll just fill all that in.

creates a lot of depth

by having all these different
planes in the painting.

and, let's put a little
bit of highlight on here

on this happy little stone.

just let that knife barely, barely touch.

barely touch, it almost
touches the canvas.

and we can just begin creating

all kinds of almighty stones, rocks.

ok, now, let's build,

let's build some happy little things here,

using van dyke brown and some
burnt umber mixed together,

little bit of sap green in it,

and let's just put, right over here,

just a happy little tree,
sitting up here on this rock.

like that.

maybe i'll, maybe over here,
oh, there's an almighty tree.

that's where these big
brushes really work beautiful,

when you wanna make big things.

alright.

here, you have to make decisions
here, where does it go,

where is the bottom of this tree?

let's just let it run right on down here

and we'll decide that later.

ok.

let's put a few little
limb indications back here,

just here and there,

like that.

and, we'll highlight it with
a little brown and white,

least little touch of blue,

just to put a little highlight on there.

ok, now we'll take some magic white,

to thin the paint a little
bit, we're going to,

little bit of yellow,
little bit of sap green.

yellow and sap green, a lot
of paint on the bristles,

and let's put some happy
little leaves back in here,

just let these little leaves
just fall off your brush,

all kinds of little things happening.

and go out sometime in the
woods, and, and study trees,

talk to trees, whatever it takes,

tree needs to be your friend
if you're gonna paint him.

probably out in your yard
you have some beautiful trees

that you can look at, study
what happens in a tree,

what makes each one an individual.

study nature.

i really, i really have some hangups

about nature being destroyed,

i would like to see nature
remain the way it is.

i would like for my son,
his grandchildren maybe,

when he goes back to alaska to
be able to see a real moose,

not just pictures of one,
so appreciate what we have.

let's put a big old tree
trunk right up through here,

this is just straight van dyke brown.

there we go.

ok, just fill that in real nice.

there, maybe there's a limb

that just travels right
up through this way,

your tree, so you put
limbs where you want em.

ok, let's take a little
bit of the titanium white

with just a touch of
umber in it, burnt umber,

and let's just put some
bark on like yesterday.

touch it, pull it to the side.

there.

let it run right on up the tree.

ok.

now, back to the magic white.

little magic white, some yellow,

and i want a darker color on this tree,

so i'm gonna use a lot of sap green on it,

lot of sap green,

want him to be darker than
the one that's behind him.

and we can throw some happy
little leaves right out here.

by being darker they stand
apart a little better.

there we go.

now, let's make a happy
little bush, right out here,

let's put some little
brighter colors on him,

so he stands out and shines.

and on down here at the
bottom there's all kind

of little things growing
out here on the stone.

ok, maybe this one right here

covers up half the tree's foots.

this is a very nice little painting,

it's a lot of fun to do,
it'll teach you a great deal,

it's a good practice painting.

it's also good for putting a happy buck

in your pocket once in a while.

there, maybe a little grassy
thing over in there somewhere.

and you can also use the
fan brush if you'd like,

and just bring all this
together very gently.

maybe right out here there's a little weed

that grows almost on the other side.

ok.

now, with the palette
knife, just a clean knife,

scrape a few little
trunks and limbs in here.

one of the important things
when you're doing this is,

don't kill all this dark
area, you really need it,

otherwise your painting
will become very flat.

you need the dark.

it's the only way you can have light.

ok.

let's go over here to the other side,

i think that tree needs a little trunk.

just touch, touch, touch van dyke brown,

little bit of highlight on
it, this is brown and white,

just enough to give it
some little indications.

ok.

now, let's highlight that
tree, a little magic white,

a little yellow and sap green,

there we are.

and, let's just put
some purty little leaves

out here on this one.

ok.

and down here at the tree's bottom,

let's put a nice little bush right here,

this is yellow ochre, beautiful color.

maybe there's a little bush
trying to live down here

on this stone, life can
get rough down there.

ok, few little sticks
and twigs here and there.

but you're beginning to see now,

how really very simple it is
to do a happy little waterfall

it's, no big secret.

it's quite easy to do.

i'm just throwing a few
little sticks here and there.

ok now, we can take the fan brush,

little bit of magic white on
it, little bit of firm white,

and now we can begin bringing
the water all up through here,

just touch and bend the
brush so it bends upward,

and pshoo, once again, tchoo,

it makes it look like
water's dripping down,

but you pull it upward,

and do it in a real fast little motion.

water's just going right on out,

little bubbly stream out from here.

ok.

now another thing that you can do

just to make it look a
little more finished,

anytime you have these big cliffs

with little things growing on,

you should always have a lot
of little roots that hang over,

just take your fan brush

with a little tiny bit of
color on it, and pull, like so.

just pull it, makes it look
like little roots hanging over,

ain't that something?

there.

just hanging there.

now, dry the fan brush off.

maybe we'll take the liner
brush, a little van dyke brown,

and we'll put a couple little stems

and stuff up through here,

maybe, maybe there's a little limb

that comes right up through here like so.

this is just a thin oil,

just about any type of oil will work,

just thins the paint down a little bit,

you may thin it with paint
thinner if you desire,

be careful because paint
thinner will bleed,

like ink on rice paper,
be very careful with that,

the oil is slick it moves much easier.

and we'll have a limb coming
right across the front.

when you're doing little trees and stuff,

one thing to avoid,

don't have a trunk and then
limbs coming just off each side,

because some of the limbs
are in front of the trunk,

some are in the back, so
have them come across,

there we go,

and just gives us a little
something right there.

few little sticks and twigs,
just little finishing touches.

and i think i'm beginning
to piddle right now,

so i'm gonna take a little bit of the oil,

little permanent red,

i think it's time we signed
this one and called it finished.

ok, work your oil in there to your paint,

it's just like water,

and turn the brush to bring
it back to a nice sharp point.

ok, lets go right along in here.

and when you have this
oil very thin like this,

it's just about like writing with a pen.

another way you can sign your name

is just take the back of your liner brush,

and you can scrape
right through the paint,

your signature will be there.

ok, i think we just about
have a finished painting here.

well this is a very, very
fun little painting to do,

it teaches you a great deal,
and i hope it helps you.

if you've enjoyed this, you
know let your pbs station know,

that's the only way we know what you like.

let us hear from you once in a while.

so on behalf of all of
us here at this station,

we'd like to wish you happy painting,

and we're looking forward to
seeing you again next week.

until then, have a super day.



- hey welcome back.

certainly glad you could join us today.

it's a fantastic day here and
i hope it is wherever you are.

tell you what let's get right on it today.

let's start out and run all
the colors across the screen

that you need to paint along with us.

while they're doing that let me tell you

what i've got done up here already.

i thought today we'd do the
little opening that you see.

the painting that the little painter man

is wiping off with a big brush

and i want to show you
how that one was made.

so i've taken just a plain
old 18 by 24 inch canvas

and i've picked up some masking tape.

it was laying around the studio here and

i've just put one square
here and one square there

of just masking tape,

that's all it is

and i've covered the whole
canvas with a thin even coat

of the liquid white.

so it's all ready to go so

let's just have a good time.

let's start out today with a
small amount of yellow ochre.

very, very small amount
on the two inch brush

and this won't be an exact
duplicate of what you see

on the opening but it's close
enough you'll see exactly

how it was made and then
you can do your own at home,

but just paint right
over the masking tape.

just like it wasn't even there.

just like so.

you had a little bit of
yellow up there in the sky.

there.

about like that, that's
all we're looking for

and this is just plain yellow ochre,

but it's blending with
the liquid white that's

already on the canvas

and all these fantastic hues

happen automatically, automatically.

okay.

tell you what,

i'm gonna grab another brush,

i have several of them
so i don't have to spend

all my time washing brushes

and go right into a small
amount of the midnight black,

don't need much, just a little,

just a little.

let's go back up here now.

now over here we'll just take that black

and we'll just begin on
the other side of the sky.

now once again this also is
gonna mix with the liquid white

and the black of course
is gonna become grey.

so we have a grey sky with
a little bit of yellow in it

and that's all that's in that

sky that you see in the opening.

i like that opening
that little painter man

is so cute.

that was the idea of a
special friend that works here

at the station, jerry morton.

he put that thing together for us.

he's very talented and i
thank him for doing that.

there.

okay, just blend these together
so you can't tell where

one color stops and the next color starts.

that's all we're looking for

and then very lightly,

very lightly go across the entire canvas

and that just removes the brush strokes.

maybe blend a little more right there.

okay great.

something like so.

now then, okay.

let me wash the old brush here

and as you know we wash our
brushes with odorless thinner.

shake of the excess.

hm, just beat the devil out of it.

oh i've got to show you something here.

i have to show you this.

a gentleman made this for me.

this is a cane that he carved and

it is unreal,

but he's actually put an image of

old bob on the end of it here

and this was done by mike weaver.

he's one of our certified
instructors in missouri

but as you can see he's
talented in many ways

but that's really
fantastic cane, isn't it?

i think he's trying to tell me something.

okay.

let's keep going here.

we'll take a little of the black.

put a little mountain in here,

little black,

little touch of,

little touch of phthalo blue in there.

maybe even a little alizarin crimson.

pull it out very flat, cut across,

get our little roll of paint.

now these little squares

we're going to play some games here

with different planes.

so i'm going to have a mountain
that projects above this

right here

and comes down.

something like so,

but i'm going to stop it right
here at this piece of tape.

there,

we'll let that come right on down

like so,

here's another peak right here.

just wherever you think a
little peak should live.

that's exactly where it should be.

right on down

and we'll stop it right
there at that piece of tape.

okay a little color right under there.

now we can take a clean
dry two inch brush,

and just grab that and pull it just like

we normally do to make a mountain.

there,

but i want to be careful not to let

that color go past the tape.

there.

if you like this painting
you can certainly do it

without the tape and it's
still a beautiful painting.

or you could make your own designs.

these designs are very
interesting and people like them.

try them.

it's very simple, you can do
it with tape or contact paper.

just any old thing that'll
stick to the canvas.

mm-hmm.

now let's just take some titanium white.

we'll pull it out very flat,

cut across,

get our little roll of paint again.

always have that little roll of paint.

now we can go up in here and

just start laying on some highlights

right on this mountain.

barely, barely touching.

barely touching.

just graze the canvas.

as i've mentioned before,
when i was teaching my son

steve to paint,

i used to tell him just to
pretend that he was a whisperer

just floating right across the mountain.

it's that light.

it's that delicate of a touch.

you oughta see what kind of
mountains he's painting today.

well you might of saw him on
some of the previous shows.

does some fantastic mountains.

he does better mountains than i do.

don't tell him i said that.

let's take little white,

a little bit of phthalo blue.

mix together.

and we use that for shadow color.

okay, i just take little edge.

let him go up in here

and maybe i'll just sort of
pull downward a little bit.

make the indication of some little

ridges back here.

sometimes it's fun to play
little games in your mountains.

then we can come back here.

just let all these little things happen.

little touch up in here.

just so we can see a little.

now we know there's tape there.

nothing's gonna show so we don't care.

we'll just bring that right across.

there

and wherever we need a shadow then

we can just lay it in.

little touch right in there.

we'll push that little rascal right back.

that easy.

that easy.

on this canvas you have unlimited power.

can do anything here.

you can change your world.

anything.

little white we just play
some games back and forth.

let that just sort of float in there.

wherever.

now we take a clean



and very dry two inch brush.

that's what all that beating was

i was just making sure it was dry,

and then very gently lift upward.

that'll help create that illusion of mist

down at the base of the mountain.

over here.

this direction and lift upward.

sometimes you can grab
just a little bit of that

and pull it.

looks like a little
light has spilled over.

it's quite pretty.

there.



okay.

now then we're ready to start

putting some little footie hills in.

so for that,

take we'll just use

that same old mountain color.

same old mountain color
with a little be right back.

a little bit of white in it.

just wanna lighten it up,

but it's the same basic color.

there.

let's go ahead up here.

very simple little foothill.

we just have it come

right on down,

down, down, down.

maybe, maybe right along there.

all we're doing is tapping with a corner.

now but watch,

come back over this way.

watch right here.

see i'm gonna let this go into this plane.

notice the mountain stops here,

but this one is gonna
come through this plane

and on over.

this about as close to
an abstract painting

as i've ever done on television.

'course i've made some mistakes at home

and we call those abstracts

but this is

the first one we've done intentionally.

i normally don't do paintings
that i have to explain.

there.

okay, now let's have a little water

down here while we have
this color on here.

we can just come right in here.

put in the indication of

a little bit of water floating around.

something like so.



there,

and this is just basic old mountain color.



okay, a little bit on
the other side over here.

i'm gonna keep right in here.

i'm gonna keep it inside of this border.



there,

and maybe down here we'll let it slip out.

something like that,

but just play games with different planes

in your painting

and you'll be surprised
at what you can create.

you will absolutely be amazed.

now then,

same color.

we'll pull a little of that straight down.

straight down,

and that'll end up being our reflections

under that little foothill back there.

gently across, that easy.

instant reflections,
that's sneaky isn't it?

there,

a little bit of the liquid white.

pull it out as flat as you can get it

and then take a knife and just cut across.

that's all there is to it.

then go up here and act just like you're

trying to cut a hole

right through the canvas

and this old canvas is tough,

you're not gonna hurt it.

not gonna hurt it,

i don't think.

if you get out the butcher knife in your

kitchen you certainly can,

but this knife is dull,

you're not gonna hurt it

and right on over into here too.

we want it to be all the way over.

okay.

now gonna mix up a little more color here.

we'll use black.

some phthalo blue,

maybe i'll put a little
prussian blue in there too.

i'm gonna begin darkening this blue down.

put a little alizarin crimson in there.

something like so.

least little touch of sap green.

alright.

okay let me wipe the old knife.

now then,

shoot let's get crazy.

i'm gonna use the one inch brush today.

fan brush should work just as well

but since i have it let's use it

and let's go in here.

now this one stopped at that plane.

let's have this group
of little distant trees.

they're bigger,

closer to us.

i remember they come right
down something like so

and we'll have these work their way.

whew, there they go.

right on up and right off the canvas.

so now each plane in the painting,

each layer of the painting has stopped

at a different point within this tape

and that's one of the things
that make this painting

so interesting when people look at it

and i guarantee if you paint this one,

people will look at it.

there, pull that down a little.

now i wanna create mist right at the base.

all you have to do is just tap.

tap it, tap it, tap it

all the way across and lift upward.

upward, upward

and that'll create the illusion of mist.

now then,

let's take,

i'm gonna add to that
same color we just had,

some brown.

little bit of brown.

little bit more of the black.

so it's a very dark color.

okay tap a little of that in there.

now i wanna have some land areas here.

i think the one that
you see in that opening

has land areas that come
right out like that.

so we put some dark in

only so our light will show.

you have to have dark
in order to show light.

it's just like in life.

if you don't have a little
sadness in your life,

you don't know when the happy times come.

there.

you know, while i'm doing this,

this is very repetitious,

i'm just gonna be putting
in some dark areas.

i wanna share a piece of video with you

from a young friend

that is just unreal.

this may be one of the youngest painters

that i've run into

and this young man's
name is earl glen russell

and he comes to us out
of springfield, missouri

and he is just a fantastic little painter.

i had the pleasure of
having dinner one night

with earl and his mother when i was there

and they're some of the loveliest people

i've ever met in my whole life

and this painting introduces
you to so many new friends

and earl and his mother
are just two of many people

that i've had the opportunity to meet.

just through painting.

there.



okay,

but isn't that little rascal good?

i mean he can paint.



all i'm doing is just making
some reflections in here

while you're doing that.

look at that finished painting

and if i remember i think
earl was nine years old now

going on 40.



isn't he something?

i am so proud of that young man.

all i've done is just tap
in a little dark color here.

trying to remember basically
where we had things.

maybe that came down about like that.

somewhere in there,

but notice as we're doing this,

we're putting the
reflections with each layer

because if i didn't pull this down,

before i did this part it
would mess up that of course.

so each layer, pull your
reflections down just like so.

before you do the next layer

and that way it'll work so much easier.

there,

now we can come back.

put in all kinds of little things in here.



something like that.

think that came right on out right there.

okay.

now then.

we can just,

we'll just use that same old brush.

we can go right into

a little of the cad yellow,

yellow ochre,

indian yellow

and then i'll hit a little
touch of the bright red,

but mix the color on the brush

so you have a multitude of
colors happening right there

on your brush.

okay let's go back up here.

now,

we'll put some nice green highlights

right out here on this little peninsula

that juts out into the water.

just tap.

tap, tap.

now then, watch.

let's play some games.

sometimes it's fun,

let me find,

we'll use a number three fan brush today.

let me pile my color up.

if your color gets too flat on the palate

you have to sort of pile it up

so you can load a brush.

so if you ever have trouble

loading the brush yet you
know there's enough paint,

just put it in a pile and
then you can load your brush.

otherwise you just polish your palate.

there.

okay let's,

go right in here and make it
look like there's some trees

that just go right out like that

but you have to put that grassy area

back in here first

then put your trees and then come back

and put your next layer.

so that it looks like there's layers

and that's what'll make your painting

stand out and be special.

alright, now then,

back to our big brush,

with all the little grassy things on it.

we can come right back in here.

see there?

and begin laying in

all kinds of little areas.

there.

you can make this just
as soft as a meadow.

okay.

now then let's have some fun.

gotta mix up some more color.

let's use some prussian blue,

some black,

alizarin crimson, sap green.

sounds good.

might as well mix up a
pretty good pile of paint.

we're gonna use it before
this one's finished.

get a big fan brush, it's time we get,

got strong here.

there.

okay.

just fill the brush up full of color.

lot of color.

now then we have to make
some big decisions here.

i think right there.

right here.

we will have a nice evergreen tree

and i'm intentionally letting
this go right over the tape.

so when we pull the tape off,

you'll only see part of the tree.

maybe we'll give him a friend.

you know me,

think everybody needs a friend.

there,

and as i say that's one
thing that painting has done.

as annette and i have
traveled around the country

teaching people,

we have made so many fantastic friends

that have been with us for so long now

and that might truly
be the joy of painting

is the friends that you make doing it.

i'm gonna take,

i'm gonna tell you what.

i was about to leave this trunk out.

poor little thing would
fall over from weakness.

take a little dark sienna and white,

little roll of paint,

and our little evergreen tree here.

let's just put

least little indication

of a tree trunk.

there.

now then,

i have dark green,

the little brush,

doesn't matter which brush you use

i just happened to pick it up.

put a few little highlights
on this rascal here.

there.

alright.

now then let's take some van dyke brown

on the old knife

and let's go right in here,

put some banks underneath this grass.

just some little banks,

wherever.

maybe there's a lot of
dirt showing right there.

there

and wherever.

we can go ahead and put
some down in here too,

'cause we know it's going
to end up being there

and here and there maybe
there's gonna be some dirt

up in here wherever.

doesn't much matter.

little touch of brown and white

and we can just tip that a little.

just to make it look like rocks and dirt.

there.

all kinds of little things are happening.

there they are.

there, okay.

now i'm gonna take my fan
brush that has the green on it

and go back in here and pop in
a little bush here and there.

just enough to sort of break up that edge

and bring all that together.

maybe there's some nice
bushes right here in front of

those little trees.

take the knife,

scrape in few little sticks and twigs

and sometimes i scratch down,

sometime i scratch up.

just depends on what kind
of mood i'm in. 

that you'll find by
touching it and pulling up

you'll get a sharper point on the end.

there if that makes sense.

let's go we'll use a one inch brush.

maybe we have a

big bush if i remember correctly,

it lives right about

here.

so we just throw some dark
in so our light will show.

push upward with a one inch brush.

create all those little,

little leafy feelings.

i'm gonna take another one inch brush,

dip it in liquid white.

i'm gonna go through the cad yellow,

be right back here,

a little sap green.

pull the brush in one direction.

loading it fully.

lot of paint.

look at all the paint.

lot of paint on that brush.

let's go up here.

now,

gently push upward.

just gently,

gently,

and turn the brush

to form all these individual little limbs

and branches.

don't just push them all in one direction.

it'll look like you're lazy.

there.

okay we can change the
flavor just a little bit

with some yellow ochre,
little indian yellow.

put another little thing right in there.

just wherever, wherever.

go back to the old two
inch brush that had all the

greens on it

and maybe

tap in just an indication,

some little grassy areas back in there.

come right down here.

somewhere in like in there.

now,

let this one come right on out.

wherever you want

and once again,

this is not an exact
duplicate of what you see

at the beginning of the show,

but it will show you
exactly the way it was made

and it may turn out better
than the one that you see

at the beginning of the show.

who knows.

okay we can take a little paint thinner,

a little brown.

make it thin like ink

and we had,

let's see here.

we right here,

we'll have a nice little tree

that lives right up there.

there he goes.

in fact there was two of them.

other one goes right
on over there somewhere

and then we can put all
kinds of little limbs

and sticks and twigs and
whatever you want on here.

there we go.

that's nice when you have a lot of time

and you can just sit and put all kinds of

little branches and sticks on here.

that's so pretty.

there.

little bit more of the thinner.

make that one a little fatter,

'cause he's the big guy.

give this one a little more body

and we're in business.

there we go.

now then,

let's have some fun.

think it's time to take the tape off

and see what we have here.

alright,

grab the old tape.



and just pull it right off there.

okay and now we'll come back,

let's get this second one.



pull it right off,

and isn't that neat?

already we have all that stuff there done.

okay.

there we go.

tape gets stuck on everything.

now then, now we can have some fun.

now i like taking the liner brush.

once again make that paint very thin

and let's go back over

and i wanna pull one of these
trees through this line.

it just,

just sort of makes it interesting.

everybody will be interested in this.

when you do it this way.

it's so different.

there,

and then, now this one,

i don't wanna come through this one,

but over here i'm gonna bring it through

if that makes any sense at all.

so it looks like it looks like this one

is behind that line.

there.

alright.

now then.

you know me and my big trees here.

let's take,

let's take the old fan brush.

fill it up full of that dark, dark color

and go right up here.

i think there was a large tree that lived,

boy he does now.

right there,

and just start,

corner of the brush,

working back and forth,

back and forth.

there.

now the one that we show at the opening

has a naked spot right there. 

he didn't grow ant fir right there.

that's why they call them fir trees.

okay.

right on down,

letting go

and all we're doing is
putting in some background

color right now.

now then he had a friend,

lived right there.

there we go.

see,

and i'm gonna let him project right out

clean over where the tape was.

so that'll push everything back.

this whole painting is a game of planes.

it's a lot of fun.

lot of fun,

you'll enjoy it.

tap in little bit of dark stuff here.

we can go back,

put the least little touch of highlight

on this big old tree.

little green and yellow,

that's all we're using.

something like that.

take our one inch brush,

dip it in the liquid white,

go through our yellows,

greens,

and let's just make a happy
little bush or two down here

and we got it.

there.

see, little touch of the
yellow ochre here and there

just to break it up.

there we are.

but isn't that a
fantastic little painting?

guarantee if you do this one,

it will certainly get people's attention.

they will love it

and i think with that we're
going to call this one finished.

from all of us here,

i'd like to wish you happy painting

and god bless my friend.



- well welcome back, glad
to see you again today.

i thought today we'd do
something a little different

and i've taken the liberty of going ahead

and covering the canvas
with a complete layer

of sap green.

and to that i'm gonna add
a little prussian blue

right on the bottom here.

and we just start at
the bottom and work up

so that it gets lighter
and lighter as we go up.

there we go.

i thought today we'd make
a happy little stream,

it's just sort of running
through the woods here.

there.

okay, we just work this
blue back and forth

so it graduates in value as it goes up.



okay.

now,

let's take, let's use this brush.

we'll take a little bit of cadmium yellow

and let's make a light source in here.

and we'll just do this by
making little x patterns.

there we go.

just work it around and round and round

so it gets it darker and darker

as it goes out from the center.

maybe a touch more.

always starting in the light
area and working outward.

there we go.

just back and forth, little xs.

okay.

now we'll take the big brush,

and very gently we'll hypnotize this.

there.

just let it blend outward.

so that we sort of have a light source,

that's all we're looking for here.

now still using the big brush,

we'll go right back into the sap green.

and we'll do some basic tree shapes here.

we push the paint into the
canvas, just really push it.

there we go.

and you need an almighty
easel when you're doing this

because you're really, really pressing

the paint into the canvas.



okay.

maybe we'll have another
big tree right in here.

okay, there it is.

isn't that fantastic, that
you can just push a tree

right out of your brush like that?

we'll have another tree here.

no use stopping,

we're having so much fun
here with these trees.

okay.

and already we have a
basic shape to work with.

we really don't plan these paintings,

we let them happen,

we just sort of decide
where we want basic shapes

and work from there.

okay, let's take the almighty knife,

a little van dyke brown
and white mixed together.

and we'll put some trunks
on these almighty trees.

and all we're gonna do is touch

and sort of pull a little bit.

it'll get wider as you go down.

there we are.



and maybe we'll have another trunk

hiding back in here somewhere.

just make all kind of little
tree things happen here.

this is sort of different
than the paintings

we've done previously,
because this painting

has no magic white on it.

all we do is start with the sap green,

completely cover the canvas,

work the prussian blue
from the bottom upward

to make it darker in the foreground.

these are the kind of things
that we continually look for,

new ideas, new ways of using
this fantastic technique.

and these ideas we put out continually

to all the people that
enjoy this type of painting,

we have a little quarterly
newsletter that we use

to put these ideas out to people

so they are current in what's happening.

okay, let's just have
another almighty trunk

right down through here.

maybe we'll highlight
these just a little bit,

with a little plain white.

just think where the light would strike

and run through here and have fun.



there we go.

and over on this side now,

the light's gonna come from
the opposing direction,

the opposite direction.

just a little here and there.

okay.

now we'll take a one inch brush

and a little bit of magic white.

and we'll start with some yellow

and a touch of phthalo green.

remember that a thin paint
will stick to a thick paint

so we thinned it just a little bit

with a little magic white,
and then we just push out

all these thousands of little leaves.

there they come.

there they are.

isn't that fantastic?

if you're painting along with us,

by now you should begin
to have little leaves

all over these trees, just
beautiful little leaves.

leave a lot of the dark areas in here,

we don't want to kill all the dark areas.

we need the dark in
order to show the light.

there.

okay, maybe we'll come right down here

and drop in another happy little bush.

there they come.

and over in here.

you want this to be the
brightest area in the painting,

back here where the light source is.

as we work forward, we're gonna get darker

and darker and darker.

mmm-kay.

maybe a little light coming
through right in here.

now put your trunk in before
you put the leaves though,

so you have leaves in front of the trunk,

you don't want the trunk sitting
on the outside of the tree.

okay.

there's a nice little bush, there he is.

and maybe over here, just
happy little thing growing.

nature's so fantastic, enjoy it.

let it, let it make you happy.

okay, there's another one.

now i'm gonna go into a little sap green,

begin using a little sap
green with this yellow

so it begins to get a little
darker as we work back here.

and we'll put some highlights
on this little tree.



there we go.

by now you should begin having the feeling

that you're walking through the deep woods

of all the beautiful
tree shapes are there,

the little squirrels
are hiding in the trees,

the bunny rabbits are behind.

there we go.

once again, don't kill all this dark area,

you need it to produce
distance in the painting.

okay.

that should give us enough
to get started with.

now we'll take the almighty fan brush

and we'll take a little
bit of magic white,

and a little bit of firm white.

and we'll make a, let's
have a little waterfall

that's happening back here,

and maybe a bubbling little stream

is just working its way through.

so often we avoid running water,

running water is a lot
of fun, so here we go.

pull it over, and let it drop,

if you're making a little waterfall.

then we take the fan brush and push,

makes the little foamy things happen.

then we begin building our running water,

and we're pushing the fan
brush so that it bends upward

and the foam's on the top
instead of on the bottom.

there we are.

let all these little things just happen.

mmm, there we go.

maybe under the water here,
there's a little stones,

causing the water to
sort of just bubble over.

you might not see this
stone, but it's under there.

as it comes towards you, let it get wider,

bigger, stronger.

more of these little things,

little actions that are happening here.



all kinds of little churning motions.

and avoid having your waterfall here

and stream coming straight
through your painting,

let it sort of wander around.

all these little water actions.

and they all hide here in your fan brush,

all you have to do is
sort of push them out.

okay, good.

alrighty, maybe

maybe back here in the distance there's,

we have a little stone back here.

we just use some van dyke brown

and we'll build us a little stone.

and maybe there's a
little stone out here too.

this is your world, so you
put stones wherever you want.

this painting comes right of your heart,

so just let it sort of flow.

let it happen.

maybe we'll take a little
bit of brown and white and

the least little touch of blue.

just to make sort of a grey color here.

and we can highlight these
little stones, just like that.

maybe there's a little ridge
coming down through here.

little sunlight playing across the stones.

a little dark edge underneath here,

so that it has some distance

between the water and the stone.

and we take the little fan brush,

and splash some water up
on the stones there, there.

there we go.

okay, maybe we'll let this

just drift right on down through here.

maybe right along here, there's another

happy little waterfall
that's happening right here.

so you take your fan
brush, and go straight,

and let it just fall over.

just like so.

isn't that something?

you can make a waterfall that quick.

just a small one, you don't want

to have a violent waterfall here,

just a little bitty waterfall.

and then we push to make
our little foamy areas

where the waterfall's gonna hit and crash.

there we go.

okay, now let's take the big brush again

and use some sap green and prussian blue.

it's getting darker as it comes down.

and we'll throw in some more
happy little bushes back here.

you need the dark in
order to show the light.



okay, maybe over here
there's a nice bush too.

let some of these bushes
protrude out over the water.

okay.

now we can take a little
more of the highlight color,

some cad yellow with a little bit

of phthalo and sap green mixed together.

i'm gonna start back
here and push this rock

back into the painting.

we just put a little bush in front of it.

there we go.

and maybe right here there's
some nice little things

that just sort of hang over the water.

okay, let's do this nice one right here.

there we go, there we go.

you can do it, you can do it.

just push that waterfall
right back into the painting.

okay, let's

let's take a little more brown here

and just put a little stone,
a little gravel out here

for all these nice bushes
and stuff to sit on.

there we go.

little highlight on the stones.



and a few little grassy things that grow

right on down the bank here.

maybe we'll even get daring

and put a little stone
out here in the water.

there.

just lay it in with van dyke brown,

then we highlight it with
sort of the grey color.

there, just let this bright play

just run across this little stone.

okay.

little more of the magic
white, a little firm white.

now we're gonna start playing
the water around this stone.

maybe it just comes around like so,

sort of falls over,
splashes a little here,

around the side, down.

all kinds of little
actions happening in this.

okay, a little bit of water

splashing up against the rocks here.

okay, now we're getting a
nice little stream here.

you can see how it's
beginning to pick up the blue

that's underneath here,
and make this water darker

as it comes closer to you.

there we go.

okay, let's go back to
good old big brush here.

little more blue and sap green.

and we'll project some bushes
right up through here now.

need a lot of paint in the
brush, more green than blue.

and we just let these run
right on down like so.



and we can highlight these with
a little yellow, sap green.

we're getting much darker in color now.

there.

just sort of vary your color tones

back and forth a little so they stand out.

leave the dark areas, that's
the only thing you have

to separate all these beautiful bushes.

mm, there's a nice one.

okay.

add a little bush right in here.

looks like some of the beautiful streams

that we have in alaska.

walk through the woods, and
you listen to, and you look at.

and they make you happy.

they have a beautiful sound to them.

you can almost hear the
bubbling and carrying on

as it travels down the creek bed here.

just with the van dyke brown
here, we're just adding

a few little sticks here and there,

you always have in the woods.

okay.

now we can take a clean knife

and just scrape through the dark areas

and let the canvas show through to give

the indication of all kind
of little sticks and twigs

that are going through here.

there they are.

just using the point of the knife here.

and these little sticks create

tremendous distance in the painting.

so many of the fast painting techniques

that i have seen around the country

as i teach this almighty method,

are very flat, have very
little depth to them.

okay, maybe now, we might
as well have some fun here.

let's take some van dyke brown,

and let's put an almighty dead
tree right up through here.

you always have dead trees in the woods

when you're walking around.

there.

be brave, go right across
the waterfall here.

and we'll just lay this in with a knife.

we're using very thick paint here.

right across the top.

and we'll just give him a little friend

right beside him here.

this whole tree's just
about, just about had it.

he's gonna sort of fall over in the stream

and be washed away here pretty soon.

but until them, he's still
part of the beauty that's

ever-evident in nature.

we'll just make him a little taller,

that way he'll make a bigger
splash when he hits the water.

okay.

now i'm gonna use the liner brush

with a little bit of thin oil on it,

a little yellow and a little
permanent red mixed together,

we'll brighten this one up a little touch.

and i'm gonna just go
down the side of it here,

just highlighting a little.

we need something bright here,

so i'm gonna just use this tree.

there.

and let this sort of streak
so it looks like bark.

okay, we'll wash him off.

and we'll use some more of the thin oil

and a little van dyke brown,

and we'll put a few old branches

that are hanging on this tree.

okay, and with the thin oil,
it makes the paint thinner.

so once again, you're working
with thin and thick paints,

the thin paint will stick
to the thicker paint.

and i recommend you use an oil,

if you use paint thinner
it has a tendency to bleed

if you're not very careful.

and the oil makes it much slicker.

there we go.

mm, there we are.

just a few old limbs here and there,

let's get a little more oil here.

and when you're working
this paint in the oil,

turn your brush, that
brings it to a nice point.

and you can make all these
delicate little limbs and stuff.

so put some over here on this one.

at home you have unlimited time,

here we're limited by our time factor,

but you can put tremendous
detail in these paintings.

so we're just trying to
give you an idea here,

we're just trying to give
you a guide to follow,

to teach you how to use
this fantastic technique.

and at home, let your
imagination be your guide,

let your heart take you
wherever you want to be.



there, look at all those little limbs.

and just in a matter of minutes.

okay, maybe we'll have one
come in right through here.

there we go.

just let them flow off your brush.

and this tree tends to push
everything back in the painting,

give it more distance.

and maybe there's just an
old hanging sort of here and

there.

there we go.

okay, we'll take a little touch
more of the highlight color,

that's yellow with a
touch of permanent red.

and a little oil in it.

and we'll just highlight some
of these major limbs here.

just let the brush flow
right down the limb.

if you have a problem,

maybe your hand's not
steady enough to do this,

use your palette or something
to sort of balance your hand.

i was very fortunate, i was
blessed with a very steady hand.

and

it comes in very handy when you're doing

these little delicate things.



okay, your little highlights over here.

there we go.

just sort of work all this together.

little bit right up here.

okay, we'll clean out the brush here.

and let's see.

what do we need here?

i'm gonna pull this
down just a little bit,

to make it look a little, there we go.

a little more of a cliff right here.

stone, very dark.

maybe right over here we'll build

a nice little stone right here too.

we have one in the water,
maybe we need one over here.

this is straight van dyke brown again.

and we'll take a little touch

of the blue and the brown and white.

okay.

just lay this on very gently,
just let the paint break.

it's a very, very gentle touch.

super gentle touch.

you almost let the knife touch.

now we'll take a little
more of the magic white,

a little green and yellow
and mix it together,

we'll make some little bushes here

to come up and protrude over the stone.

you need a thin paint to go over the top

of this very thick paint
that you've put on.

so there we go.

and we put some little grassy
areas around the trees' foots.

okay.

alrighty.



and we wanna splash that
back up on the stone here.

like so.

okay.

good, i think we just about

have our little stream finished today.

and if you're painting along
with us, you should have

just about completed this painting.

i might put a few little
touches here and there.

as i say, at home you have time to put in

tremendous detail, you
can work and carry on

and build all kind of happy
little things in here.

here, we're limited by
the amount of time we have

so we're just trying to show
you the basic technique,

the basic idea.

need a little highlight
on this little dead one

that's laying right out through here.

okay.

just a little sticks here and there.

little brighter color so they show up.

there's one right in front of the stone.

okay, i think we'll just
take a little thin oil,

permanent red here, and
we'll sign this painting.

little more oil.



and i hope you've enjoyed this.

this is sort of a new idea.

as i say, we've used no
magic white on this canvas,

just pure sap green.

this will work in a multitude of colors,

you can paint the canvas with blue,

with combinations of
colors, and make some of

the most fantastic little
paintings you've ever seen.

one of the prettiest
ones is to paint it with

van dyke brown, and make
beautiful autumn scenes out of it.

and the brown is picked up by the yellows

and oranges and reds and
just, it just stands out.

fantastic painting.

okay.

we'll just sign this one.

there we go.



yeah.

and we'll call that painting finished.

once again, i hope you've
painted along with us,

and you've enjoyed this picture.

it is a lot of fun.

and we hope to see you again next time,

and we'll do another
happy little painting.

until then, from all of
us here, happy painting.



hi glad to see you again today you ready

to a fantastic seascape i thought that's

what we'd do today so let's start out

and have run all the colors across the

screen that you need to do this seascape

with me and that's going up here let me

talk just a little bit while they're

doing that i started with a good old

standard 18 by 24 inch canvas but i've

done something a little bit different

today the top part of the canvas is

totally covered with a thin even coat of

liquid white all the way up here down

you can see this little line here now

from here down is covered with liquid

clear now this is just like liquid white

only it's clear that's all so let's go

and do a fantastic little seascape i'm

gonna start out with a 2 inch brush and

a small small amount of the cad yellow

very small amount just beat it into the

bristles a little bit can't go up here

now then maybe we'll have a beautiful

bright little sky today so i'm just

gonna start with a little yellow do

something like so just let that mix with

the liquid white there now without

cleaning the brush go right in to a

touch of yellow ocher load the brush the

same way go back up here now right

around the edges of that see there still

use the little crisscross strokes we'll

just bring that right around sort of

like so there we go

and if a little happens to get down here

in your painting don't worry about it

don't worry about it it's no problem at

all

okay still without cleaning the brush

will go right into bright red a little

bit some very strong okay now that right

around those edges take a little bit of

this beautiful red color just like so

not pretty already we have a we have a

painting for the museum of modern art

here you can just stop right there now

that i want to put a little bit of red

over here and just let it work right

along right in here is gonna be the

horizon there we go

and we just very lightly blend all this

together okay now then i have several

brushes go in son i'd spend all my time

washing i'm gonna take straight titanium

white just straight white and go right

up in this area and i want this to be

very bright too so i'm gonna take white

and put it right there straight titanium

point now it won't show up much because

light against light is nothing but you

just wait i'm gonna grab it and pull it

just pull grab it and pull we don't care

what happens in here we're gonna cover

all that effort we now then let me wash

it a brush

and we just wash our brushes with

odorless paint thinner shake them off

and beat the devil out of them

okay we can just use this same old brush

i'm gonna go into a small amount of

phthalo blue and reach up here and grab

a little touch of alizarin crimson so we

have phthalo blue and alizarin crimson

proportionately much more crimson than

blue i want this to be a little bit to

the reddish side okay there's very

little paint on the brush let's go back

up here now then let's take and use just

the corner of the brush using little

circular little circular strokes and

let's just begin laying in some happy

little clouds maybe there's one that

lives oh look at there look at her there

he is

hanging out there look at that see how

easy it is to make all kinds of

beautiful little cloud shapes all you

need is just the corner of the brush

there we go

okay man then over here we'll put him

had a little clout liz right there there

we go and in your world you decide where

the clouds live and you put as many or

as few as you want

cheery decision there we go

just wherever maybe there's one right

there still using those tiny little

strokes little circular strokes just

with a corner of the brush okay let's

say i have i have several brushes going

here now with a clean brush i'm just

gonna very gently blend this a little

don't have to over blend it just enough

to sort of mix it up like so there we go

still using little round strokes little

circular strokes you can blend this till

it absolutely goes away all we want to

do is blend it just enough to soften the

edges so it comes already a minute watch

here then we'll take this and very

gently three hairs and some air very

gently just bring it all together you

don't want to lose your shapes

i just want to soften all the edges and

then you can even do like katniss the

head just brings it right over makes it

look like little light streaks coming

through there now then to really add a

little more contrast i'm gonna mix a

little more color the same color crimson

and phthalo blue there's room crimson

they go blue but a little darker a

little more on the brush and right in

here i want to show a cloud that's a

little closer so for that we'll just use

a little darker color and it'll give the

impression this cloud is closer to us

see how easy that is you can create all

kinds of beautiful little things

happening in here all right

they would go back to our clean brush

stir this up a little bit

just mix it don't over to don over to

it's easy to get carried away and then

very lightly two hairs of some area this

time it gives the impression now that

that cloud is in front a little bit

so it helps creep the illusion of depth

and distance in your sky and you can put

a couple hair in there wherever but that

easy you can make a fantastic fantastic

sky looks like a nice sunset already and

if you if you want to you can go in here

with a fan brush and you can add some

little streakers little streaky clouds

that easy

and you can put as many of these in as

you want just want to show you how clean

dry brush and then blend them right into

the paintings there we go in that a

beautiful sky and you can do it wash it

and brush i have some paper towels over

here i just dried a fan brush that's the

fun part of this whole technique already

now then we have to make a big decision

here let's take that's take let's take

just take earth phthalo blue alizarin

crimson and i'm gonna make a dark dark

lavender color on the palette it should

look black all right we got her mixed

here now then probably let me show you

one other thing first one of the easiest

ways to help you with a seascape

because it's sort of hard at first till

you practice a little i'm gonna take the

little filbert brush here and to that

i've added a bunch of paint thinner so

this is thinners water nearly sort of

sort of come in here and sketch out

where you want the major wave to be and

let's just say it's gonna live boom

right there and this is not a commitment

at this time you can still change it

soon comes up like it maybe it comes

over maybe the foams gonna crash up in

here somewhere like that

now our shoreline maybe it'll come oh i

get something like it that just helps

give you a little bit of sort of a

layout and it'll really save you a lot

of trouble

okay after you practiced a while maybe

you don't need to do this but at first i

really recommend you do it that way too

it'll help you lay it out here i'm using

that dark color we made it's a very dark

lavender color see if we've we had used

liquid white here when we put this on it

would pick up the white and you would

lose this beautiful beautiful dark color

there liquid clear allows us to mix on

the canvas without changing the value of

the color we'll just come right on down

in here in here we're gonna have the

transparency or the or the bright spot

of the wave that's the part of the wave

if you into selling paintings that's the

part of the wave it sells that's what

everybody wants to see that big big

crasher will come right in here hmm just

sort of follow this guide all we're

doing here is putting in some dark color

so our light will show later on i may

add a little more color a little more

color that's repentance

phthalo blue now when you're doing these

at home you can add all kinds of colors

other times balogh green is very pretty

and seascapes oh it is dynamite color

beautiful it's very strong and be

careful with it see all of these we have

all of our dark areas blocked in when

you're using a big ol two-inch brush you

didn't take but a second met a beautiful

rich color alright now we can really

start playing let me grab my fan brush

i'm gonna take same old colors alizarin

crimson and phthalo blue and let's head

let's put some on the fan brush here

just load it back and forth like it not

a great deal of paint on the brush okay

let's go up here maybe there's a little

footling back here that's a fancy name

for a rock sticks out in the water mm

little peninsula we back in the distance

and this is too far away to show details

so don't worry about it all we're

looking for here it's just a basic shape

okay tell you what - that was so much

fun this - another one maybe there's

another bigger stone in front of it here

bigger foot but this will help create

the illusion of distance in your

painting and you can put all kind of

things back here you can put little

trees on these foot limbs and just

whatever but it really helps so you

chose different planes in your painting

hope you can see that

now if it if it doesn't show up quite

low enough you can take and they had a

little little highlight to it they just

you get it to stand out a little more

maybe that'll help can see that a little

bitter now there we go good okay and

that click we've got a happy little

putting back here alright now we can

begin putting in some of the good stuff

how to start with just plain ol titanium

white

and we'll go right up here and just

begin putting in some happy little

highlights we back hearing a distance

barely barely touching barely touching

and sort of like you make all these

little things happen bring it right

around the base of this little little

foot line back here now then let's have

some fun let's go like right in here

watch here grab it and discover all

right i've liked it oh what have we done

now and maybe there's another one right

here and back and let's go right along

here like that

right along there it's got easy that is

cleaning off the old brush here okay now

then i'm going to taken another fan

brush it's clean and very gently very

gently yeah i'm just gonna begin doing

it like so

see just work that back pay very very

close attention to angles all you want

to leave in here is the dark area this

is a time when the dark areas are much

more important than the light areas that

right in here same thing same thing see

just blend that up like you

hmm that's began they looked pretty

already okay yeah we can go right into a

little bit of white sea and begin making

all these little things that are far far

away little swells that are far in the

distance don't want too much detail back

there okay good

this is this painting it'll teach you to

be an expert brush washer let's go back

into our blue and crimson blue and

crimson just mix it right on the palette

all right now this area here we have to

put dark in before we can put our light

in so that's just add a little bit of

dark color right here see how easy that

is

follow that basic angle so look at that

oh we're doing is just applying dark

we'll come back later put all the

highlights on the good parts everybody

wants to jump on these good parts but

you have to do this you have to do the

framework first okay now that we got

some dark from there let's take some

white i'll just use some titanium white

a lot of paint on the brush now a lot of

paint i'm okay

madam grab this and pull it pull it

strokes are very important you might

need to wash you or wipe your brush

sometimes you can just wipe it in

between each stroke because you're gonna

pick up some of this under color see

here my cat

okay

yeah then that's let's get our little

filbert brush here i'm gonna go into

white and the least least little touch

of cadmium yellow white and yellow white

yellow okay let's go up here now then

let's go right in here this this is the

part that makes the painting so pretty

this is it all we're doing here it is

scrubbing in some color and the light

would come right along the top of this

wave because the waters thinner here

look at that just like so maybe there's

a touch even right over in here just a

little bit right in there with a clean

dry be sure it's dry it's most important

clean dry 2 inch brush come right in

here very very gently just begin

blending this

we're gonna begin picking up some of

this nice rich lavender color we have

down here and blending it right up into

it this is where we begin forming the

basic angle of the way now

i beat the brush just to remove excess

paint is it doesn't matter if a little

that color goes up in there that light

the light area will remain let's grab it

before okay let me find my little

filbert brush here we'll use some of

this lavender color that we have same

old lavender color how to touch it white

end there we go now let's begin putting

some foam and first we put the shadows

in and you take this brush and just lay

it over and just really scrub it in get

tough with it

get mean with it think about water

churning and bubbling and maybe it comes

away up here and crashes and splashes

and all kinds of fantastic little things

are happening and this is only the

shadow only the shadow will come back

and put the highlights on you in the

second

fill this in this needs to be good and

dark also like the aunt and with our

clean brush we want to continue this

angle just grab it and bring it through

okay now be sure you're filled with

brushes good and clean and dry now comes

the fun part

this is what we wait on take white cad

yellow load a lot of paint into the

bristles just really fill the

son-of-a-gun up okay now then sort of

hold a brush here and give it a little

upward push and it's that upward push

that's where the splash happens and when

you begin running out of paint turn it

over and use the other side to brush and

usually you just wipe off the excess you

don't have to go through the whole

cleaning procedure you want to keep this

color as pure as you can i'm just gonna

mix with what's on there okay plenty of

paint on the brush plenty of paint

splashing we appear all kinds of

beautiful little things are happening

continually wipe that brush keep it good

and clean

and we'll have a little bit mm well you

get carried away with these you can

really get carried away in the hewa

super tire seascapes are fun okay

coming off the brush okay now with a

good clean dry brush you just want to

sort of mix this together that'll make

it sort of make a different value a

medium value here cuz it'll mix with the

dark and the light brings it all

together just stir it up a little bit

okay

good clean dry two inch brush just the

corner and just mix this up all you have

to do it's just very gently bring all

this together very gently this is two

hairs and some air barely barely

touching and that easy we have it yeah

i'm gonna take a paint thinner yellow

and white and be sure your paint is as

thin as ink so a very thin water

consistency let's go right up here this

nice bright area here there's gonna be

all kinds of light shining through just

put all these happy little things paint

at home when you have unlimited time you

can just really go in here but all kinds

of beautiful beautiful little things

okay

come ride along here and just sparkle

that like so mm-hmm all right yeah let's

take some white a little touch of the a

little blue very little blue white and

blue and let's begin working on some

happy little things that are just

floating right on down through here all

kinds of little this is where you begin

forming the wave this gives it shape and

gives it character okay

back in here

just bring it right on back let's have

some fun right into that light area i'm

gonna go right into some cad yellow

we'll just throw that right on there

right into the yellow ocher just like we

did this guy let's drop it in right into

some bright red we got us a fireball

going here then i'm gonna reach into

dark sienna a little bit more dark

sienna here then right into van dyck

brown over here i want to get quite dark

so it makes that light really stand out

okay now then let me touch you white

right there and then with a clean brush

all you have to do is blend all this

together just blends together specter

color sort of mix and then lightly

lightly quickly let's go across like let

go across then we'll take a fan brush i

want to put titanium white or the least

least little touch of a little blue on

it and it must come right in here and

begin making all kinds of happy little

foam things just laying out here having

a good time leave some of these dark

areas leaves and dark areas

don't kill them all

begin paying attention to the shape of

the wave it's very important very

important over here

yeah well i got to brush going i'll just

take it right into some brown and that's

half maybe just some sand right here

all right there it is look at there just

put this is just brown with a little

touch of white that was left on all

right down like yeah a little bit of

sand on the beach van dyck brown dark

sienna a little touch of white little

seagulls we got to have a place to run

okay yeah take a little paint there with

some dark paint we just run a little

lion and into here like so

paint thinner with some of the light

blue and we can just put the indication

of a little a little bit of water

playing all down here on the beach but

all kinds of little lines and stuff here

and there see how easy that is

it really makes some nice nice effects

and let's have a happy little stone

lives right there this is just van dyke

brown

shoot i tell you i will have that a

little stone right there go a little bit

down grab it makes a reflection take the

little knife and we'll put the least

little touch of some highlights on here

like so the old clock on the wall is

telling me got to stop for today so with

that i think what called this painting

finished i sincerely hope you've enjoyed

it

that'll give you a good idea of how to

do a fantastic seascape happy painting

god bless

you

- hi, i'm bob ross,

and for the next 13
weeks, i'll be your host,

as we experience the joy of painting.

i think each of us,
sometime during our life,

has wanted to paint a picture.

i think there's an artist

hidden in the bottom of
every single one of us.

and here we will try to show you

how to bring that artist out,

to put it on canvas.

because you too, can
paint almighty pictures.

you know, we have avoided
painting for so long

because i think, all of
our lives, we've been told

that you have to go to
school half of your life,

maybe even have to be blessed
by michelangelo at birth

to ever be able to paint a picture.

and here we want to show
you that that's not true.

that you can paint a
picture right along with us.

each week we'll use the same colors,

we'll use the same equipment,

so if you have your brush
and pallet ready next week,

you can paint right along with us.

i'd like to go over some of the equipment

that we'll use before we start.

the brushes that we use.

i'll be using very large,
two and a half inch,

and one inch, natural bristle brushes.

now these are natural bristle.

be sure you don't start
with a nylon brush.

we'll use an almighty palette knife.

and this is much different

than the traditional palette knife.

it is not thin and flimsy,
it's a firm palette knife.

and with this we can make
fantastic things happen.

let's go over the colors that we'll use.

we're gonna start out
here with titanium white,

phthalo green,

prussian blue,

van dyke brown,

alizarin crimson,

sap green,

cad yellow,

and permanent red.

now these eight colors, we'll
use each and every week,

for every picture that we do.

so you don't have to go out

and buy 1500 different
kinds of colors and brushes.

you need very little
equipment to paint with this.

another thing, we'll do no
tracing of patterns on here.

we start with the vision in our heart,

and we put it on canvas.

and we're here to teach you
to be able to do this too.

so, let's do it.

let's paint a picture right here.

we're gonna to start with a big brush,

and were gonna cover the canvas

with a thin layer of magic white.

now this is a wet-on-wet technique,

so the first thing were going
to do is get the canvas wet.

and all we want is a nice,
even coat of paint here.

there we go.

just cover it nice and even.

you also need an almighty
easel when you're doing this.

you need an easel that will
hold your canvas very firm,

and allow you to use these big brushes.

okay.

when you're using a large brush like this,

it really doesn't take too
long to cover your canvas.

and if you get a hair like that,

just pop it off with the
corner of your brush,

flip it away.

okay.

now after you get your canvas
covered with a magic white,

we'll take and make long
strokes back and forth

to get a nice even
distribution of paint on here.

okay.

up and down one time.

that assures that the magic white's

nice and even all the
way across the canvas.

okay, let's wash the brush out here.

we wash our brushes with
odorless paint thinner.

okay, we'll wash them out.

and i beat the brush
just to dry the bristles.

now let's take a little
bit of cad yellow here,

and i think today we'll
do a picture that's,

maybe like were walking through the woods.

and so let's start right here

with a little bit of cad yellow,

with just the least little
touch of phalo green in it.

and we'll out a little bit
more of the green color,

and we'll begin making little x's,

just like so.

just work that around.

okay.

now without cleaning the brush,

we'll go right into some prussian blue.

just add it right onto the brush here.

we'll just go out here.

and were making the crisscross
strokes, little x strokes.

there.

already we're beginning
to have a light source

in this painting.

okay, now we'll clean the brush again.

once again, this is
odorless paint thinner.

we do not use turpentine.

now with a nice clean brush,

i'm gonna take and add just a
little bit of titanium white,

right here in the center.

just a little.

and we'll begin working outward.

there.

by now maybe you have recognized

some of the equipment we're using

as something you've seen before.

and i learned this fantastic
technique wonderful man

that i think all of us have enjoyed

for many many years on tv,

bill alexander.

and bill taught me this many years ago.

it is the most fantastic way to paint

that you've ever seen.

so join us.

have some fun.

and we'll just blend this
out a little bit more here.

until we have a nice blue sky.

there we go.

okay, we'll clean the brush one more time.

now let's start putting in
some almighty trees here.

we're gonna start with a
little bit of alizarin crimson,

and a touch of prussian blue.

now the prussian blue is

the crimson, so use just a
little blue and a lot of crimson.

and here we're going to begin
pushing in basic tree shapes.

so just bend the brush.

bend the brush.

make those little leaves and branches

just pop right out at you.

there he comes.

these little son of a
guns hide in your brush

and you just have to push them out.

this is your world, your creation.

let's put a little one right here.

and maybe we'll just put
some little grassy areas

coming down through here.

and right there, there is one.

you're pushing quite firm here.

this is why i say you
need an almighty easel

when you're doing this,
an easel that's strong.

okay.

maybe over here on this side now,

we'll add another one.

maybe a bigger one over here.

there he is.

and there's no secret to
this, anybody can paint.

anybody can paint.

all you need is a dream in
your heart, a little practice.

there, already we have the
beginning of a beautiful picture.

we have the tree shapes, the light source.

looks to me like it's
early in the morning.

okay.

now, let's put some trunks on these trees.

and for that will take a
little bit of van dyke brown,

and let's just lay in
some basic trunks here.

there we go.

and maybe we'll put a little
limb right here, like so.

maybe a little something right there.

there we are.

okay, now this little fellow over here,

he needs a trunk too.

so we'll put one right in here.

and maybe some limbs up in here.

right through here, there we go.

just some indications here and there,

and some little sticks and twigs.

maybe over here.

there we are.

okay.

now we'll highlight these,

and we'll take a little bit of white,

and a touch of brown mixed together.

and remember where your light source is.

so this tree, we'll highlight right here.

like so.

there we are.

now over on this side,

the light's coming through here,

so we'll highlight this side of it.

maybe a few little
indications up through here.

now comes the fun.

now we can begin putting
all the beautiful leaves

and stuff on this, and just
really make it come alive.

so here, we'll take a little
bit of the magic white,

to thin our paint.

one of the golden rules in this,

this is a thin paint, we'll
stick to a thick paint.

so anytime you're painting
over the top of paint,

you need to have a paint that's
just a little bit thinner.

we'll take a little bit of phalo green

and a little bit of yellow,

and we load the brush full of paint.

and out light's coming through here,

so we want the side of the tree

to be a little brighter
than the other side.

all right.

and then we begin pushing

thousands of little leaves on here.

they hide in your brush.

there they come.

just a little on this side over here,

because not as much light's gonna strike.

a little's come through, but not as much.

and look at that.

in just a matter of a few minutes,

we have a beautiful tree.

now maybe, this little tree over here,

we'll put a little highlight on him.

and once again, we're using a paint

that's a little bit
thinner, so that it sticks.

first thing that you have
to do when you're doing this

is start with an oil paint
that's very, very firm.

your base paint has to be extremely firm.

if you start with a thin, loose paint,

your gonna become a mud mixer.

you have to have a thick
paint on the base coat

in order to get this
thinner paint to stick.

now let's begin building some
bushes and stuff in here.

all right, look at that.

you can do it, i know you can.

there, look there.

okay let's move to this
big tree in the front here

and let's put some nice
little leaves up here on him.

you have to bend that brush.

if the brush doesn't bend,
you're not gonna get all these

beautiful little leaves, these
little actions that happen.

okay, maybe there's a nice little bush

that lives right here.

you know if you've ever
walked through the woods

early in the morning, all the
little creatures are out here.

they're all playing in
the bushes and stuff.

this is where they live.

in all these bushes.

okay, let's put something
on this side now.

nice little bush here.

just let your imagination run wild.

let your heart be your guide.

in the time you sit
around worrying about it,

trying to plan out painting,

you could have completed
a painting already.

let it happen, let it happen.

you know for so many years
i was a traditional painter,

and i would spend sometimes
weeks just working on a picture,

drawing it out, getting all
the little sketches and stuff.

and then i'd go back
and spend maybe a month

trying to fill in the blocks.

and here, we let it happen.

it comes right out of here, it's in you.

and you put it on the canvas.

okay, let's see.

let's try this big ole tree here,

put some nice little leaves on him.

there we go.

yeah.

mmm.

okay, let's try, i've added
a little permanent red with

my color now, just to give
us a little different value.

okay, and you know if we're
going to walk through the woods,

we need a little path.

so let's take a little bit
of van dyke brown here,

and let's build us a happy little path.

we're just gonna take the
knife and let this path

sort of just wander
right down through here.

there we go, just let it wander
'round, play and have fun.

okay, there we got us a nice little path.

now we need to highlight
that path so i'll take

just a little bit of white,

and we'll just take it and
barely touch the canvas here.

just enough so we can highlight

where the sun's sparkling through here.

there, see how easy that is?

let the paint break.

and now in order to set the
path down into the painting,

we'll add some bushes that
project up over the path

here and there.

push 'em in.

there we go.

and you can see how that
makes it literally drop

right into the painting.

okay, let's put some
more land aries in here.

maybe this nice little area's
coming down through here.

just like so.

maybe we'll have some over here.

follow the angle of your land.

there we go, there we go.

there, now maybe, maybe, maybe,

as we're walking through the woods here,

maybe it rained last night.

maybe it came a nice little rain.

there's little puddles.

you know after it rains you
always have little rain puddles.

so let's take a little touch
of the prussian blue here,

and we'll just make us a little puddle.

and we put some prussian
blue on the brush,

and we take here and pull downward.

just pull downward like so.

there we go.

okay, see how easy it is to do?

now.

very gently, we'll come across this way.

just to give it a watery effect.

now if you want to, if you
wanna put highlights in here,

maybe you could take just a little touch

of the titanium white on
your brush, and pull down.

it'll give it sort of a sheen.

there and then once again
just come across just enough

to give it a nice watery feel.

you can overdo this part very easily.

okay, wash off the ole brush.

okay, now we can take a little
more of the van dyke brown

and we can just make
little puddles out of this.

maybe it comes down like
so, right through there.

there we are.

okay, little puddle.

and we just make this a little
separate puddle back here.

just like that.

okay, now we take a little
bit of brown and white,

and we'll lay a little highlight on there.

there we go.

and in your world, you can do anything

that your heart desires.

my home is in fairbanks, alaska,
and i spend a lot of time

walking around the woods
and talking to trees

and squirrels and little
rabbits and stuff.

and i look at a lot of nature.

and if painting teaches you
nothing else, it'll teach you

to look at nature with different eyes.

it'll teach you to see
things that have been there

all your life, and you've never noticed.

and if it does nothing else
but make you enjoy nature,

it's worthwhile.

so look around, look at what we have.

beauty is everywhere.

you only have to look to see it.

okay, i talk too much sometimes

so we'll go back to painting here.

take a little bit of the
thin white paint here,

and we'll put some little
water lines back in here.

okay, just like so.

there we go.

there, and maybe some little
water lines right here.

this is just a thin white paint
and you literally just cut

right into the canvas with it.

and let's smooth that out.

there we go.

okay, now while i have the
knife here, i'm gonna take it

and just cut a few little
sticks here and there.

and all we're doing is
just literally cutting

right through the paint.

so the canvas shows through and it makes

a multitude of little sticks,

and these little sticks
help create the illusion

of distance in a painting.

all different planes.

okay, now then, let's
put some bushes and stuff

right down here on the
grass, on this soil area.

there we go.

there they are, there they are.

they just live right here in your brush.

and you just drop 'em right in.

there.

okay, now let's take and do this.

let's put some land
right down through here.

back to the van dyke
brown, little bit of white.

there we go.

we'll add a little highlight on here.

there.

and we'll put a few little
bushes and stuff right out here.

see how easy that is?

okay, a few more little
water lines in there.

just let 'em happen.

each week, we'll try to do
paintings that are designed

to teach you something
different, something new,

something exciting.

just to keep your interest going.

okay now let's play a little bit here.

let's have a happy little
tree right in here.

so we'll start with the van
dyke brown, and we'll make

his little trunk here.

there he goes.

straight van dyke brown to start with.

there and we just turn him
out to give him little foots

to stand on.

there.

and maybe he needs another
little arm out here.

so we'll just give him one.

this is your creation,
you can do anything here

that you want to do.

just let it happen.

there.

now, and we'll give
him some little leaves,

and we'll use some more
of the alizarin crimson,

a touch of prussian blue.

okay, and we need dark
in order to show light.

so first we'll put some dark on here.

i'll put some happy little
leaves here and there.

when we see you next
week i hope you have your

almighty easels set up, the colors ready,

your big brushes all
primed and ready to go,

and do an almighty painting with us here.

very quickly while i'm
finishing this up i'll go over

the colors, one more time, that we use.

titanium white, phthalo
green, prussian blue,

van dyke brown, alizarin
crimson, sap green,

cad yellow, and permanent red.

only eight colors that you need.

okay now let's put some highlights

on this pretty little tree right here.

mmm, i used just a little
touch more of the permanent red

on this one so he'll
stand out a little more.

see how easy it is to create a tree

right here in your world?

there we go.

and maybe down here, maybe
there's some nice little

bushes and stuff happening right in here.

there we go.

all right, maybe right there another one.

okay, here and there i'm gonna put

just a few little sticks and stuff.

like that.

just, once again, to build
some distance in here.

we want this to have a lot of depth in it.

maybe we'll cut in a few
little sticks here and there,

like so.

you gettin' excited yet?

you ready to paint with us?

you can do it.

okay, and i think this
painting's far enough along,

we'll just sign this rascal.

and i sign the painting
with a script liner brush,

a little bit of oil, and i
use red paint, but whatever

color you prefer.

okay, and we'll just sign that rascal.

i hope you've enjoyed this painting.

next week we're looking
forward to seeing you.

i hope you have your brush ready.

a dream in your heart that
you want to put on canvas.

and join us, right here,
at the joy of painting,

and you too can build fantastic pictures.

you can take 'em from
here, and put 'em on there.

until next week, happy
painting, from all of us here.
