00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:06,502
(instrumental music)

2
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:32,725
- Hello, I'm Bob Ross

3
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,239
and I'd like to welcome you to

4
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,083
the 27th series of The Joy of Painting.

5
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:38,588
If this is your first time with us,

6
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:40,753
allow me to extend a
personal invitation for you

7
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:41,787
to drag out your paints

8
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:44,048
and some big, ol' unorthodox brushes

9
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:47,013
and I'll show you how to do
some fantastic little landscapes

10
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,475
that you can do.

11
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:49,382
So I'll tell you what,

12
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,013
today let's start out and
have 'em run all the colors

13
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,752
across the screen that you need

14
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,651
to paint this little painting with us,

15
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,262
and while they're doing
that let me show you

16
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:57,924
what I've gotten done up here.

17
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:02,106
Today, I've taken an
18 by 24, double prime,

18
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:05,242
pre-stretch canvas and I've
just covered the entire canvas

19
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:06,960
with black gesso.

20
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,166
And black gesso is just an acrylic paint

21
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,162
that makes the canvas black.

22
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:13,274
I've allowed that to dry completely.

23
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:16,826
On top of that, take a little
piece of contact paper here,

24
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,639
any sticky back paper

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,763
cut an oval, stuck it on there.

26
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:22,849
Then on the inside here,

27
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,939
after we have the contact paper on,

28
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:26,912
I've taken a little bit of liquid clear

29
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,120
and covered the entire inside.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,786
Then we've taken alizarin crimson,

31
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:35,734
just plain ol' alizerin crimson
covered the entire canvas.

32
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,610
And on the corner over
here I've put a little bit

33
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:38,987
of phthalo blue, just so it's sort of a

34
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:41,311
lavender color over here.

35
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,253
I know it sounds complicated
but believe it or not

36
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,858
it is extremely simple.

37
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:46,468
Black gesso, liquid clear,

38
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:49,370
alizarin crimson, a little
phthalo blue in the corner

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,873
and just blend it out.

40
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:53,775
And with that let me show
you how much fun we can have.

41
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:56,197
Let's start today with a

42
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:57,896
least little bit of indian yellow.

43
00:01:57,896 --> 00:02:00,200
I just want a very small amount.

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,501
Just a small amount.

45
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,100
And I'll go right up in here and get

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,914
a little bit of white on there.

47
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:06,513
So we have a little indian yellow

48
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:08,699
and a little bit of titanium white

49
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,246
on a little two inch brush.

50
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,252
Let's go right up in here.

51
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,939
Now, let's decide where
our light area will be,

52
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,425
and right in here let's
start making little X's,

53
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:20,380
little criss cross strokes,
something like that.

54
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,841
And we just begin letting that blend

55
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,266
outward and upward.

56
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:27,168
I want this to be the
lightest area in my sky.

57
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:32,678
So with that, all we have to
do is start making little X's.

58
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,177
Little more paint on the brush,

59
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:36,743
and we just continue to blend.

60
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:38,695
Isn't that fantastic?

61
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:41,170
I love these black canvasses

62
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,961
because you put the
transparent color on there,

63
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,775
they still look black,

64
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,216
but when you start painting

65
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:49,117
you add a little white, or
yellow or something in there,

66
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:50,834
and they come alive.

67
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:53,201
Notice that I'm always
taking the pure color

68
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:56,615
back to the lightest
area and working outward.

69
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,420
That way we assure that the lightest color

70
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,762
is right in there, and
that's where we want it.

71
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,554
Alright.

72
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,574
Look at all those beautiful colors,

73
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:07,830
they just... they happen automatically.

74
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,867
This is a very, very
easy style of painting.

75
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,447
Anybody can do this.

76
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:15,099
I get letters everyday from people

77
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,955
all over the country.

78
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:19,046
They say, "I never believed I could paint,

79
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:21,649
but I've tried what you
showed me on television

80
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,068
and it works for me.

81
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,826
It works."

82
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:25,770
Alright.

83
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:28,475
Now I want to make that
a little brighter yet.

84
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,610
So I'm going to take some
more of the titanium white

85
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,978
and a little bit of canyon yellow,

86
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,154
it's very bright yellow,
very strong yellow.

87
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:37,903
Just a little.

88
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:39,621
Now I'll go right up in here,

89
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:41,403
and just above there,

90
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:42,697
add a little bit of that.

91
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:44,447
There.

92
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:48,662
Just, still making little X's
with the criss-cross strokes.

93
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,461
Something about like
that, let it blend upward.

94
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:56,977
Once again, always start
in the lightest area

95
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:58,439
and work outward,

96
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,945
because you're gonna pick
up this transparent color

97
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:02,685
this on the canvas and automatically

98
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:05,564
it will get darker and
darker as you work away

99
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:07,276
from that center area.

100
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:10,133
Something about like so.

101
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,486
There.

102
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,884
We'll take the little blender brush

103
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:16,072
and come back and smooth
all that out in a second.

104
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:18,511
In the meantime I'm going
to grab another brush.

105
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:19,769
I have several of them
going so I don't have

106
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,290
to spend all my time just washing brushes.

107
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:25,731
Take a little white and let's get crazy,

108
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,001
shoot, let's get a little
bit of this bright red.

109
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:30,459
That's a gorgeous color
but it's very strong.

110
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,872
Be careful with it.

111
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:33,894
Just a tap a little into the bristles,

112
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:36,010
that's all we're doing, just tapping.

113
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,735
And maybe up here now we'll...

114
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,444
maybe... yep.

115
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:42,257
There's some, just some
happy little things

116
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:44,997
that happen up here in the sky.

117
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:46,341
Just little things like this,

118
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,724
and we'll dance a few
little colors in here.

119
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,567
In your world you put any color

120
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,519
or any shape that you want.

121
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,695
Painting is a very individual thing.

122
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:59,344
Everybody will see nature
through different eyes

123
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:00,293
and that's the beauty of it.

124
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,730
You can paint any world
that you want here.

125
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:04,723
Any world that you want.

126
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:07,478
Maybe there's a little
dooer comes out here,

127
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:08,460
I don't know,

128
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:10,016
doesn't really matter.

129
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,930
You decide.

130
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,634
Take a little blue, a little crimson,

131
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:15,680
just mix them on the brush here.

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,879
Make sort of a little lavender color

133
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,295
but to the reddish side.

134
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:24,715
Now the blue is many, many
times stronger than the crimson,

135
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:26,729
so proportionately you need
much, much more crimson

136
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,655
than you do blue.

137
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:31,978
Then I'm just gonna begin laying in some

138
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,264
little colors under in here
and wherever we want them.

139
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,312
Just have fun with this, let it happen.

140
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:40,219
Let it happen.

141
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,444
We don't do any drawings or tracings,

142
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,140
we really learn to create here.

143
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,920
We let our imagination take us

144
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,875
to worlds we never knew existed,

145
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,987
and in those worlds we find peace,

146
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,491
we find happiness.

147
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,282
Good things happen here.

148
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:59,024
Little blender brush,
it's a very soft brush.

149
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,346
Very soft.

150
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:03,766
Make a nice, nice makeup brush even.

151
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,627
But with that, because
the paint we use here

152
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,792
is very firm and very dry,

153
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,391
very thick paint,

154
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:13,528
we can take this little
blender and go right over it.

155
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:14,579
Just like that.

156
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,289
Isn't that something?

157
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:18,747
That easy.

158
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:22,837
There, we can just work on this a little,

159
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:23,841
and the more you blend this

160
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,624
the more it just goes right
into those background colors

161
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:29,104
and gorgeous things happen automatically.

162
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,471
Automatically.

163
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,663
Put a little white paint on there,

164
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:35,930
maybe we'll brighten that
a little, right in there.

165
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,794
I want that to stand out.

166
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:41,156
Something about like that.

167
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:43,753
Alright.

168
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,262
Okay.

169
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:48,606
Now that, it's time to
have some fun in here.

170
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,691
Let's get a little fan brush,

171
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:52,627
take a fan brush.

172
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:54,462
I'm gonna mix up,

173
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,105
we'll take some alizarin crimson,

174
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,133
a little bit of the phthalo blue,

175
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,787
maybe even put a little black in there.

176
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:03,189
Like that.

177
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,572
I'm gonna get a little titanium white.

178
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:09,109
I'm looking for sort of a... mmm...

179
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,480
that color.

180
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,829
That color right there.

181
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,866
Sort of a grey,

182
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,680
grey to the blue side.

183
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,266
Okay?

184
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,591
Let me wipe the knife off.

185
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:20,396
Let me just wipe the knife
of a little paper towel.

186
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,584
Take the fan brush,

187
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:24,365
and we'll load both sides full of color

188
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,641
just by going back and forth.

189
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,225
Alright.

190
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:31,074
Now then up in here, maybe
in our world back in here

191
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:32,749
lives some little evergreen trees.

192
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:36,439
and sometimes you can make
gorgeous little tree indications,

193
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,578
just taking a little fan
brush and pushing upward,

194
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:41,458
just push it upward.

195
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,848
We'll make all kinds of little trees.

196
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:45,427
I'm gonna add the least
little touch of white there

197
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:46,909
so it stands out a little better,

198
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,613
so for television it shows up.

199
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:50,617
There.

200
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,867
That shows up a little better.

201
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:54,052
But in your world you make them

202
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:57,362
any degree of darkness or
lightness that you want.

203
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,480
There we go.

204
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,875
Wherever, wherever.

205
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,408
And did you know, if you've
painted with me before,

206
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:06,200
we don't make mistakes.

207
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,569
We have happy accidents.

208
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:11,160
And all that means is
that very soon you learn

209
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,880
to work with anything that
happens on this piece of canvas.

210
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,846
Literally anything that happens.

211
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:20,227
Because sometimes things that
you think are big mistakes

212
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:22,061
and you're really worried about,

213
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,920
when the painting's
finished they end up being

214
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,324
the highlight of the entire painting.

215
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,489
There.

216
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:31,651
And each painting will
teach you something.

217
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:33,581
Learn from it.

218
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,181
As long as you learn from an experience

219
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,176
then it's not wasted.

220
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:38,921
It's not wasted.

221
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:42,174
It's only wasted when
you accept it as failure.

222
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:44,146
And we don't have any failure here.

223
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:46,570
We don't have any.

224
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,616
It's against the rules.

225
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,723
In Bob's world, that's against the rules.

226
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:54,206
Now then, I'll go back
to a two inch brush,

227
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:56,275
be sure it's clean and dry,

228
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,857
and I want to create the illusion of mist

229
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:00,638
down at the base of this.

230
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,336
So all we do, firmly, with
the top corner of the brush,

231
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:04,745
just tap.

232
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:05,955
Just tap it.

233
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:09,990
That's really and truly
all there is to it.

234
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,552
Then we're gonna lift slightly upward,

235
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,316
just enough to take out
the little tap marks

236
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:18,027
and sort of blend everything
together and make it very soft.

237
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:20,075
Now, it looks like a little
row of trees that lives

238
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:22,735
wee wee back here in
the distance somewhere.

239
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:24,708
Just happy little trees.

240
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:28,288
Now, I'm going to go into
crimson, blue, and black

241
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:29,962
same colors

242
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:33,727
but this time I'm gonna add much much less

243
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:35,700
of the white color to it.

244
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,134
Much less.

245
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:39,966
There, I want it to be quite a bit darker.

246
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:42,293
In a landscape painting, as you know,

247
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:44,287
as things get closer to you

248
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:46,153
they should get darker
and darker in value.

249
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,585
This is sort of a lavender color.

250
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:51,230
Load both sides of the ol' fan brush,

251
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,374
and let's put another row of trees.

252
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:54,921
Another thing that you find when

253
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,268
you're doing landscapes,

254
00:09:57,268 --> 00:10:01,353
the more plains or the more
areas that you have in here,

255
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,677
the deeper that your painting will look.

256
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:06,995
That's what gives a
painting depth, distance.

257
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:10,893
That's what will make your
painting very, very special.

258
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,852
When people look at it they'll
say, "Oh I can look in there

259
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,745
and see forever."

260
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:17,149
There.

261
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,138
And that's what does it.

262
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,348
Maybe this comes,

263
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:22,418
yeah, why not?

264
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:23,596
Right up in here.

265
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,867
Something like that.

266
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,155
And we're just looking
for indications for trees.

267
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,362
These are too far away
to see a lot of detail.

268
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:34,101
We'll put a little detail
on them but not much.

269
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:35,682
Not much,

270
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:38,147
we get too much detail it
will ruin that illusion

271
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:40,379
of distance in your painting.

272
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:42,774
And that's a good friend.

273
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,486
We want that.

274
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,230
Alright,

275
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,438
now if you want to give
a few of these trees

276
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:51,372
the indication of a little
more detail, just do that.

277
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:54,275
Take the corner of the fan brush

278
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,895
and make it look like here and there,

279
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:58,011
and there and here,

280
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:01,447
there's a big strong tree
that lives up in here.

281
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,471
Maybe he got more sunlight or more water,

282
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,832
and he grew big.

283
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,579
Just wherever you think they should be.

284
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,617
Just drop them in.

285
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:13,168
Like that.

286
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,222
Shoot, I think we about have that.

287
00:11:15,222 --> 00:11:18,234
Maybe a couple over on this side.

288
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,254
But that easy, we can make a
pretty nice little background.

289
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,432
Go back to our little two inch brush here

290
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:28,080
tap a little on the bottom,

291
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:32,074
just enough to create
that misty illusion again.

292
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:32,794
Very lightly.

293
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,999
Very lightly.

294
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,066
Lift upward.

295
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,662
Very lightly.

296
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,497
Something like that.

297
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:43,096
You know for many years I
was a traditional painter,

298
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:45,656
and one of the things, when
I was a traditional painter,

299
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:48,761
that was extremely difficult
was making reflections,

300
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,501
and in this technique it's
one of the easiest, nicest,

301
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,474
most effective things that happened.

302
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,297
Watch here.

303
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,682
Come right up in here.

304
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,165
All you have to do is
touch the canvas with

305
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,139
a little titanium white,

306
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,538
we have color on the canvas already

307
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,840
and pull it straight down.

308
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,783
It's important to come
straight down though.

309
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:07,239
Straight down.

310
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,723
It'll pick up all those
gorgeous transparent colors

311
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:11,692
that we had underneath there.

312
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,034
That easy.

313
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:15,836
And very gently, we go across.

314
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:17,817
Just like that.

315
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,406
See there?

316
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,629
And instantly it begins
looking like water.

317
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,508
Time to wash the ol' brush.

318
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,423
If you've painted with me before,

319
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:29,716
you know this is really the whole thing,

320
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:33,012
it's the most fun part
of the entire procedure.

321
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:35,080
Shake it off.

322
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,933
And just beat the devil out of it.

323
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,046
I thought maybe today we'd
have a little snow scene.

324
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,691
I'll show you a very
easy way of making snow.

325
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:45,533
Very easy way.

326
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:46,995
We'll just take titanium white

327
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:49,076
we use that same ol' two inch brush.

328
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:51,516
This is one of the simplest ways

329
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:53,449
of making very nice snow.

330
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:55,123
Tap it.

331
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:56,168
If you've painted with me before

332
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:59,251
this is the way we make
little grassy areas,

333
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,650
but I want to make snow
that looks powdery,

334
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,296
like, well skiers call it powder so

335
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:06,147
sometimes snow looks like that.

336
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,370
All you do is just tap.

337
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,870
Just tap.

338
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,607
Something like so.

339
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:13,699
Very gently.

340
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,140
There.

341
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,557
See?

342
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:17,997
That's all there is to it.

343
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:18,828
All there is to it.

344
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,227
All you're doing is
just tapping the canvas.

345
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,274
And we'll go back to this very, very soft

346
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,414
blender brush.

347
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:26,203
It's very soft.

348
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:27,549
Get a clean one

349
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,591
and gently

350
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:32,631
just graze it just enough

351
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:35,126
to bring it together.

352
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,379
And it'll give that
indication of very soft snow.

353
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:38,912
Watch here,

354
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:40,075
watch here, watch here.

355
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:40,704
I get excited.

356
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,889
I've probably painted a
million pictures, I think,

357
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,097
and I still get excited with this.

358
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:46,911
Maybe in our world

359
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:48,117
maybe this tree

360
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:49,118
watch here

361
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,388
you can grab trees and pull
them into the foreground.

362
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,131
This easy.

363
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,155
Just gonna take that tree

364
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:57,193
bring it right on down

365
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:58,654
and we'll bring it right here

366
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,139
so it pushes that little snowbank back.

367
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,485
It goes back behind it now.

368
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:05,341
It works so good in me we'll
have one over here, too.

369
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,784
I like that.

370
00:14:07,784 --> 00:14:08,594
I like that.

371
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:09,918
And this is your world so you can do

372
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,592
anything that you want here.

373
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:13,010
Any ol' thing that you want,

374
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,770
there it goes.

375
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,911
Have one there.

376
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:16,701
Let's give him a friend.

377
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:19,201
I like to make evergreen trees.

378
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,778
They work so well and
they're a lot of fun,

379
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,197
and they're gorgeous.

380
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,581
Absolutely gorgeous.

381
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,779
Now we can go back to our ol' brush here

382
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:31,304
that has the titanium white on it,

383
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,716
load a little bit.

384
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:36,051
And you work in layers.

385
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,192
See we did the thing that
was in the background first.

386
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:40,813
And now we'll begin working forward,

387
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,467
forward, forward.

388
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:46,200
Always starting with
the most distant object

389
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,891
and working forward.

390
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:49,331
There we go.

391
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:52,494
On the other side we'll do the same thing,

392
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:55,394
we'll bring it right underneath this tree.

393
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,620
Just right on out,

394
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,626
a little join together there.

395
00:14:58,626 --> 00:14:59,963
There.

396
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:02,331
Alright.

397
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:05,150
But isn't that a super easy way

398
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,976
of doing a very effective illusion?

399
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:10,019
Just making snow?

400
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,233
Back to our little blender brush.

401
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:13,757
Very lightly.

402
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,131
Two hairs and some air.

403
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:18,540
Very lightly, just blend that.

404
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,426
Now we have that white on the brush,

405
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:24,509
let's go back and
reinforce this reflection.

406
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:25,470
I want to make it a little brighter

407
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,445
so it jumps out at you.

408
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:29,318
Just like that.

409
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:30,890
And go across.

410
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:34,326
Just like that.

411
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:36,284
Now then,

412
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,674
just take a little bit
of the liquid white.

413
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,525
Liquid white is just an oil based medium.

414
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:45,506
And we use it to thin paint,

415
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:47,223
we use it to cover the canvas,

416
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:48,845
and we use it to make water lines.

417
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:50,498
Just cut across, can you see that?

418
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:52,770
Just cut across with a knife.

419
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,605
And we go right up in here

420
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,204
and let's just cut in a little water line

421
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:58,059
that lives right there.

422
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,248
Right there.

423
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:01,798
That's all there is to it.

424
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:05,174
These water lines should be
basically straight though.

425
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,491
By that I mean going
back and forth across,

426
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:10,565
because if they're not straight your water

427
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,714
look like it's gonna run
right out of the painting.

428
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,855
You might have to tie a bucket on the side

429
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,845
to catch the overflow.

430
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,935
There.

431
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,582
Maybe down in here
there's a little ripple.

432
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,306
Whatever.

433
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:26,703
Whatever.

434
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,505
It's up to you.

435
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,728
Totally and completely.

436
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,500
There we are.

437
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,005
Like that.

438
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:37,257
Now then,

439
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:40,302
you ready to get crazy?

440
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,071
Let's do it.

441
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,862
Let's have some big fun.

442
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:46,882
Let's take a phthalo
blue and alizarin crimson

443
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:47,694
and no white,

444
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:48,856
it's just blue and crimson.

445
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:51,992
I'm making a very deep lavender
that should look black.

446
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,072
Tap the bristles of the brush firmly

447
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:55,662
into the paint.

448
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:57,912
Give it a little push.

449
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,533
And time to get crazy,

450
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,346
this is your bravery test.

451
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:02,391
Maybe we've got a big tree.

452
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:03,992
You know me, I like big trees.

453
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,868
Yep, there it is.

454
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:07,480
There it is.

455
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,159
It lives right up here.

456
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:12,673
And I'm using, just mainly
the corner of the brush

457
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:14,961
oops went right over that tree.

458
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:17,252
That's alright, we know he's back there.

459
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,865
Maybe, maybe, maybe in our world

460
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,636
maybe there's a big bush.

461
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:25,456
You're right, he lives right there.

462
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:28,481
Just sort of make these
things up in your mind

463
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,222
and let them go whever you want them.

464
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:32,268
Maybe there's...

465
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,687
maybe there's a whole
little group of bushes

466
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,913
that live here.

467
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:36,817
I don't know.

468
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:40,576
A little bunny rabbit has
to have a place to hide.

469
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,480
And that's a pretty good one right there.

470
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:46,273
We can take our liner brush,

471
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,144
use a little of the dark sienna,

472
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:49,942
and I'm thinning the paint because

473
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,423
one of our golden rules is

474
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:54,901
a thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

475
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,277
Thin will stick to thick.

476
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:59,750
Taken this dark sienna, a
little bit of white in it,

477
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,915
just enough to dilute it a little.

478
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,910
And here and there we're gonna just put in

479
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:07,324
an indication of a few
little tree trunks and sticks

480
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:08,764
and twigs that live back.

481
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:10,622
Not looking for a lot of detail.

482
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:12,160
Not yet.

483
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,163
We're gonna put some
detail in the foreground

484
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:16,045
but not yet.

485
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:18,535
And we'll probably cover most of those up

486
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:19,943
but a few of them's gonna show through

487
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:21,875
and it'll look like you worked
yourself to death up there

488
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,586
trying to get all those.

489
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,547
Let's go into a little
white and a little touch,

490
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:27,795
a little touch,

491
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:29,373
of phthalo blue with it.

492
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:31,164
Just enough to cool it.

493
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:32,561
Not much.

494
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:33,948
Titanium white, but push it,

495
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:35,358
push it.

496
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:38,058
You can see that little
ridge of paint right there.

497
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:39,594
There's one just like it on your brush

498
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:41,193
and that's what we end up painting with.

499
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:43,817
Push it, about a 45 degree angle.

500
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:47,288
Now very lightly, using just
the corner of the brush,

501
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:52,259
just begin tapping in all kinds
of little things in there.

502
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:54,057
Okay, maybe we need to load

503
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,178
a little more paint on the brush.

504
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,582
Now if you have trouble making a stick,

505
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:03,253
add the least little touch of liquid white

506
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:05,365
or paint thinner.

507
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:06,644
The liquid white will make your color

508
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,612
a little brighter,

509
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,142
the paint thinner will
leave it the same color.

510
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:13,741
They both work very well,

511
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:16,476
make up your mind what you want to do.

512
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,338
If you want it to be a little brighter

513
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:19,693
then add the liquid white.

514
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,315
If you want it to stay the same color

515
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:22,499
paint thinner.

516
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:24,141
But very little, no matter what.

517
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:26,008
Very little.

518
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,586
The secret to this painting technique

519
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:31,832
is to keep your oil paints
as firm and dry as possible.

520
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:35,201
That way you can continually
paint over the top of it

521
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:36,546
without them mixing together.

522
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:39,586
You don't want to become a mud mixer.

523
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,122
And if you've painted,

524
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:43,365
we've all mixed a little mud.

525
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,442
There we go.

526
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:46,093
See?

527
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:48,440
Now think about, think about
little individual bushes

528
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,034
and stuff that live in here.

529
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,033
I'm gonna dip the brush
into a little touch

530
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,564
of the liquid white myself.

531
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:56,742
Just to thin that down
so it sticks easier.

532
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,526
There we go.

533
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,132
Think about shape and form.

534
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,115
Don't just throw these in at random.

535
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:04,321
One at a time.

536
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:06,294
Do the one that you think is farthest away

537
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:08,919
and work forward, forward, forward.

538
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:11,046
Always working forward.

539
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:13,158
There we go.

540
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:15,232
One at a time.

541
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:16,394
One at a time.

542
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,315
I know you get tired of hearing that,

543
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:19,317
but it works for you.

544
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:23,590
And I want this, I want you
to enjoy success with this.

545
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,076
Cuz if you enjoy success
you'll get hooked on it.

546
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:31,230
I enjoyed some success with this

547
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,907
many years ago.

548
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:35,785
And it has become my entire life

549
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:36,969
and I love it.

550
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,551
Let's go into vandyke
brown and some dark sienna.

551
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,500
We'll just mix them together.

552
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,867
Vandyke brown, dark sienna

553
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,855
bravery test time.

554
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:47,400
Maybe in our world there lives

555
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:48,904
you ready for this?

556
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,504
There lives right here,

557
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:52,898
in one stroke,

558
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,338
let's put a nice tree trunk.

559
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:58,448
Alright let's give him a friend.

560
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:01,574
Yeah I know, I think everybody
should have a friend,

561
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,291
even a tree.

562
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,847
Even an ol' tree.

563
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,119
A little titanium white,

564
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,787
this is a birch tree, I've decided.

565
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,153
Touch, give it a little round-ward pull.

566
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,817
Let me exaggerate. (whistle)

567
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:14,949
That way.

568
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:17,449
Gotta make that little noise, too.

569
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:18,788
See there?

570
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,174
Just make it look,

571
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:21,402
no pressure.

572
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:23,491
Let the knife just barely, barely touch

573
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,423
so the paint breaks.

574
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:26,649
And by breaking I mean it leaves

575
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:29,384
all those little open holes in it.

576
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:31,219
There.

577
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:35,437
On the other side, a little
bit in the other direction.

578
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:36,595
Like so.

579
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,386
There.

580
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:40,464
Wherever you think they should be.

581
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:42,233
Something like so,

582
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,165
we can go back to the dark sienna

583
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:45,731
and vandyke brown mixture,

584
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:47,358
add a little bit right in the middle,

585
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:49,262
and when this dries

586
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:50,228
and it dries,

587
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:52,581
it will feel like real birch bark.

588
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,149
It'll project off the canvas.

589
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,439
The paint's think, there's a lot of it.

590
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:59,843
It really, really jumps

591
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:00,967
right off there.

592
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,431
Let's go back to our little liner brush.

593
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:06,807
Get a little of that vandyke
brown, paint thinner.

594
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:09,432
The thinner's there
only to thin the paint,

595
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:10,727
make it very thin.

596
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:12,423
Very thin.

597
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:15,716
And here and there let's
just put an indication

598
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:17,359
of a few little limbs and

599
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:20,009
little things that live out here.

600
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:22,710
This little tree needs some arms on him.

601
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,319
Shoot, he's got to reach
out and talk to this guy.

602
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,542
There we go.

603
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,162
Just a few.

604
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:32,051
Just a few.

605
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,235
That works so well, I think it's time

606
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:36,366
to really get crazy.

607
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:37,859
Let me put a little bush down here.

608
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,943
I want to cover up his foots.

609
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:41,730
Down here at the base of this,

610
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,400
just wanna cover his foots up.

611
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:46,307
Right now they're sort
of just hanging there.

612
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:48,238
But we'll make them come
right out of that little bush.

613
00:22:48,238 --> 00:22:50,488
Right there, right there.

614
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:52,504
I'm going back into my brown.

615
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:55,266
Big bravery test.

616
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:58,289
Right there.

617
00:22:58,861 --> 00:22:59,738
Right there.

618
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:03,109
Maybe this is a different
kind of tree here,

619
00:23:03,108 --> 00:23:05,310
just to break it up a little bit.

620
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,754
Let's take some white,
a little dark sienna,

621
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:08,726
mix it together.

622
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:09,888
Put a little vandyke in there, too,

623
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,798
what the heck.

624
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:13,814
Take a little bit of paint and

625
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:16,314
all we're gonna do is just begin touching,

626
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:17,876
just touch,

627
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,173
something like so.

628
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:21,775
There we are.

629
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:23,241
Just touch it.

630
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:24,607
Touch it.

631
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:26,254
That's all. Touch.

632
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:29,972
And as you work around

633
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:31,369
we're gonna let it get darker and darker

634
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,851
and darker and darker.

635
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:34,292
As it goes around the tree.

636
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,500
Put a little brown with your color,

637
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:38,196
a little of that vandyke brown,

638
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:39,957
see it gets darker automatically.

639
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:42,652
Once again when this is dry it will

640
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:45,067
actually feel like bark on a tree.

641
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:49,334
Alright, wipe the knife off.

642
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,435
Back to the paint thinner.

643
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,942
Little bit of vandyke
brown with paint thinner.

644
00:23:53,942 --> 00:23:56,236
Just to thin it.

645
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,028
And let's put an arm on this tree.

646
00:23:58,028 --> 00:24:02,181
Maybe it lives in our
world right out in here.

647
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:06,740
Boy, this would be a gorgeous
place for a tree to live.

648
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:09,887
Gorgeous place for a tree to live.

649
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,077
Maybe there's another arm right here.

650
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,769
It's up to you.

651
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:17,253
You decide how many arms are on your tree.

652
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:18,725
Or how few.

653
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:21,414
Maybe your tree died
last year, or sometime,

654
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:22,459
and it's just about

655
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:24,544
just about over.

656
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:26,660
Make up little stories
when you're painting,

657
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:30,373
little stories just in your mind.

658
00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:32,144
And then you actually project yourself

659
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:33,786
into that scene.

660
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:36,575
And when you do, this
becomes a reality sorta.

661
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:40,846
And you know, painters are expected to be

662
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,841
a little strange so,

663
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:44,591
that's alright if you stand
around and talk to yourself

664
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,673
about this scene and the
ol' guy that lived out here

665
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:48,873
or whatever,

666
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:52,125
that's alright if people
look at you a little strange.

667
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:55,399
Painters are supposed to be that way.

668
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:57,752
Maybe out in here there's just

669
00:24:57,752 --> 00:24:59,975
a little ol' stick that lives.

670
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,809
Use a little of the light color here.

671
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:05,613
Wherever you think that should be.

672
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:09,384
It's up to you.

673
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,466
Up to you.

674
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,649
I'll tell you what, maybe
there's an ol' limb.

675
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,200
Right there.

676
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,920
Something like that.

677
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,135
He's a tired old limb.

678
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:21,366
Now you can take the knife

679
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:24,378
get that brush clean,

680
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,218
and you can scrape through this and

681
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:28,842
allow the black canvas to show through.

682
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:30,581
And it'll look like
little sticks and twigs

683
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,423
that live back in here.

684
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:32,730
I hope you can see those.

685
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,425
When you do your own
painting you'll see them,

686
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:36,158
they'll be there.

687
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,604
Something about like so.

688
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,951
Alright, that's all there is to it.

689
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:45,288
I think we're about ready to
take the contact paper off here

690
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:47,401
and see what we have.

691
00:25:47,402 --> 00:25:48,842
This is the moment of truth.

692
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:51,096
So we just grab the paper

693
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:52,599
pull it right off.

694
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,713
And all of a sudden you have a painting

695
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:57,625
that's right there in that oval.

696
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,065
And it comes out so gorgeous,

697
00:25:59,065 --> 00:25:59,961
and it just,

698
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:01,870
these painting's excite people.

699
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,939
I know none of us are
interested in those happy bucks

700
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,051
but if you're out selling paintings,

701
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,256
these are different.

702
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,273
You'll be surprised at
how people will come along

703
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:11,298
and they'll marvel at how you did this.

704
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:13,447
It's very very nice.

705
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:16,194
I think it's time to
sign this ol' painting.

706
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:19,546
And with that, we'll take a
little bit of the bright red.

707
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:22,644
Signatures are as unique as painters.

708
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:25,481
Each person will develop
their own signature.

709
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:26,590
So find your own signature.

710
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,542
I've had people that sign with initials,

711
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,877
with their whole name,

712
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:31,733
I've even known people who've signed

713
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:32,890
with a little symbol.

714
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,469
It's up to you.

715
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,517
But pick a signature and stick with it,

716
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:38,490
because it becomes your trademark.

717
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,208
And people a hundred
years from now will look

718
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:44,158
at your painting and recognize
exactly that it was you.

719
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,066
Alright, let's go right in
here and just sign this one.

720
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:50,915
I have a very short
name, so it's quite easy.

721
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:52,998
We'll sign it, call it done.

722
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:55,051
There.

723
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:56,651
And I hope you enjoyed this one.

724
00:26:56,652 --> 00:26:58,113
It's a very easy painting,

725
00:26:58,113 --> 00:26:59,990
I'd love to see some photos of your work.

726
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,307
