1
00:00:00,865 --> 00:00:03,878
(soothing music)

2
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:24,540
(car horn honks)

3
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:31,532
- Hello, I'm Bob Ross

4
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,932
and I'd like to welcome you to series 31

5
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,440
of The Joy of Painting.

6
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,120
If this is your first time with us,

7
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,955
allow me to extend a personal invitation

8
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:40,992
for you to drag out
your paints and brushes

9
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:43,062
and paint along with us each show.

10
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:44,522
And if you've been with us before,

11
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:46,731
please allow me to thank
you for inviting us

12
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,837
back for another series of painting shows.

13
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:50,772
Tell you what, let's start right off today

14
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:52,779
and have them run all the
colors across the screen

15
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,773
that you need to paint along with us.

16
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:55,914
While they're doing that, let me show you

17
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:57,749
what I got done up here.

18
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,249
Today I'm using an 18 by 24-inch canvas.

19
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:02,659
It's pre-stretched and double-primed.

20
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:04,894
And then I've just
covered the entire canvas

21
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:06,957
with a very thin coat of liquid white.

22
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:09,427
This is a wet-on-wet painting technique,

23
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:11,656
so the liquid white is there only

24
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,064
to make the canvas wet.

25
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:15,582
It allows us to actually blend
color right on the canvas,

26
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:17,346
rather than working ourself to death.

27
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:18,627
So let's do that.

28
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:20,147
Tell you what, we'll start off today

29
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,772
with a little two-inch brush.

30
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:24,972
There we are, we'll take a
little touch of phthalo blue.

31
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,829
Phthalo blue's a beautiful,
beautiful blue color.

32
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,914
Just tap a little into the bristles.

33
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:32,684
We don't need a lot.

34
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:35,489
All right, let's go right up in here.

35
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,582
Now we'll start just making little X's,

36
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:41,665
just little criss-cross
strokes, that easy.

37
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:45,292
That easy, and we'll work all
the way across the canvas.

38
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:48,960
Now we start at the top and work down,

39
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,164
that way the paint is continually mixing

40
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:53,739
with the liquid white that's
already on the canvas.

41
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:56,785
And automatically, your sky will get

42
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,967
lighter and lighter as you
work down toward the horizon.

43
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,057
And in a landscape, that's exactly

44
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,490
what we're looking for.

45
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:07,647
There, let the canvas work for you.

46
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,542
Allow the colors and the paint,

47
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,849
everything to work
together to make it easy.

48
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:15,145
This is a painting
technique that you can do.

49
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:17,947
There's no big secrets here.

50
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:19,568
People who've never painted do this

51
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:21,631
every day and it works for them.

52
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,677
All right, I think I'll have some water

53
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:26,782
in this painting today, I love water.

54
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,157
It's easy to paint and we'll just take,

55
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:31,145
we'll use that same old phthalo blue.

56
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:33,288
Just add a little more onto the brush.

57
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:36,030
Now still water is always level

58
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,397
and I think today, let's have still water.

59
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:42,813
So pull from the outside to in, like so.

60
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,362
That's all there is to it.

61
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,949
We'll go to the other side and do

62
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,543
the same, identical thing.

63
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:52,471
But I suggest you pull
from the outside in.

64
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,307
If you start here and go across,

65
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,742
it leaves a big line and
it's very hard to work out.

66
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,338
There, so pull from the outside in.

67
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,319
And it leaves a little area in here

68
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,356
that's sort of light, if everything works

69
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,396
just right, it'll look
like a sheen of light

70
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,576
just streaking right across your water.

71
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,296
Sneaky, but it works great.

72
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:15,313
There we go.

73
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:19,243
Now then, I wanna darken
the corners on this,

74
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:21,143
so I'm gonna take a little Prussian blue.

75
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:23,407
Prussian blue is much, much
stronger than phthalo blue.

76
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,432
It's a beautiful blue though, let's take

77
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:29,066
a little of that and
right up in the corners,

78
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,763
I'm just gonna add a small amount

79
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:33,936
of the Prussian blue, like that.

80
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:36,932
Now when the painting is completely done,

81
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:39,051
these dark corners will help lead the eye

82
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,878
toward the center of the painting.

83
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:44,730
There, that's really all there is to it.

84
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:47,177
And we'll put a little in the water too,

85
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:48,538
we don't want it left out.

86
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:51,908
Just down at the bottom
and let it work upward.

87
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,896
There, shoot we're in business already.

88
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,252
Thought today we would just do

89
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:02,388
a little mountain scene, it's
very pretty, very easy to do.

90
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,078
All right, now see even
though we're blending

91
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,421
across that, that little light area

92
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,347
still, it remains in there.

93
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:14,264
Okay, we'll just blend that
color 'til it's nice and smooth.

94
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,012
And we're in business.

95
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:18,802
Now comes the most fun part of

96
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:20,834
the whole technique and
that's washing the brush.

97
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:23,165
If you've painted with me before,

98
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:26,317
(laughs) you know this is
where I really have a good time

99
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:28,502
is cleaning this little brush.

100
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:30,940
We wash our brush with
odorless paint thinner,

101
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,515
shake it off, then (brush thumps).

102
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,413
Then just beat the devil of it.

103
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:38,497
That really is the fun part
of this whole technique.

104
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:42,697
Tell you what, today let's take,

105
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,933
we'll use a little bit of phthalo blue,

106
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:47,573
some alizarin crimson,
little bit of black.

107
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:51,433
I wanna make a little mountain in here.

108
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:55,562
And I wanna make a dark
lavender-looking color,

109
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,367
very dark, very, very dark.

110
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,122
Maybe a little more crimson.

111
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:02,877
Proportionately, much, much
more crimson than blue.

112
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,651
Kay, let me wipe the ol' knife.

113
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,713
And we just wipe the
knife on a paper towel.

114
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:11,614
Now it's most important
how you load the knife.

115
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:13,881
Take, cut across the paint and get

116
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,317
a little roll that lives right
on the edge of the knife.

117
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,269
Okay, let's go up in here.

118
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,589
Tell you what, put a
little white with that

119
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,791
and I wanna make a distant mountain first,

120
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:25,970
little mountain that lives far away.

121
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:30,737
So I've added a little
white and maybe, yeah.

122
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,007
Right in here, just decide where you think

123
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:36,049
this little mountain lives in your world.

124
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:40,209
And drop it in, painting
is a very individual thing.

125
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:43,312
We all see nature through different eyes.

126
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:45,681
And that's the way you should paint it.

127
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:48,994
There, all we're looking
for is a nice top edge.

128
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:51,121
We could care less what's
happening down below.

129
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:55,483
Our brush is good and
dry and we'll grab it.

130
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:57,717
Because the Liquid white's on the canvas,

131
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:00,730
you can literally move color, see there?

132
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,613
If you were working on a dry canvas,

133
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,402
right now you'd be in agony city.

134
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:09,072
But because it's wet, it will move.

135
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,370
And your brush strokes will create

136
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,759
the illusion of highlights and shadows

137
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,801
right there in your mountain.

138
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:19,023
And that's about all I need.

139
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:22,723
That mountain's gonna be
far away, very distant.

140
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,273
Now I go back to the solid dark color.

141
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:27,625
And, come right up in here.

142
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,379
Let's go right up in here.

143
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:32,217
I want you to see how dark it is.

144
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,124
Don't be afraid of it 'cause it's dark.

145
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:37,977
We're gonna put a few
little highlights on it,

146
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,976
but you decide where all the little

147
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:42,807
protrusions on your
mountain live, little bumps.

148
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,776
Maybe, yeah, how about one right there?

149
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,514
But it's that easy and there is

150
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:52,204
no right or wrong here.

151
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,376
The only rule that we have here

152
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,996
is that painting should make you happy.

153
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:58,579
You should enjoy it, and if it does that,

154
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:02,124
then it's good, then it's good.

155
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:06,653
All right, I get letters from youngsters,

156
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:08,349
some of them in their nineties,

157
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:11,110
that tell me they never
believed they could paint

158
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,237
and they've tried this,
and it's worked for them.

159
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,124
That's what makes this all worthwhile

160
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:18,727
is to hear stories of success from

161
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,653
all over the country and you
can do it, you can do it.

162
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,016
There we go, now once
again, I'm gonna pull this.

163
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,713
One of the rules if
you're painting mountains,

164
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:32,336
always remember if you can
see the entire mountain,

165
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,331
it's always more distinct on the top

166
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,021
than it is on the bottom

167
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,396
'cause we have mist and now we have

168
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:41,807
wonderful pollution that sorta lays

169
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,641
around the bottom of the mountain

170
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:46,473
and it breaks up and diffuses the light,

171
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,955
so it looks softer.

172
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:52,961
There, now sometimes, tell you what,

173
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,418
let's get crazy today.

174
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,976
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes,

175
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,649
while I got that color going, it's fun

176
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:03,984
to take and reflect a
mountain right into the water.

177
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:07,728
Now we're just looking for a
basic little reflection here.

178
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,127
We're not too worried
about it being exact.

179
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:14,927
In our world, we can do it
close enough, like that.

180
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,998
Now sometimes, sometimes you may find,

181
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,598
when you first start, it's easier

182
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,179
to take the canvas off your easel

183
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:26,058
and turn it upside-down and just

184
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:28,442
basically re-paint the mountain.

185
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:30,836
If that works for you, that's okay,

186
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,505
any way that it works.

187
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:35,939
Now, I'm gonna take, and just like we did,

188
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:40,100
I'm gonna pull that
color, just wanna pull it.

189
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:43,475
There, once again, the liquid white

190
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:46,062
allows you to move color on here.

191
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,201
That easy, that easy.

192
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,686
All right, see and that gives us

193
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:58,531
a basic reflection
there, may not be exact,

194
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,620
but it's close enough
for what we're doing.

195
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:03,127
All right, let me wash the brush.

196
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:07,447
Wash the ol' brush, shake
off the excess there.

197
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,815
(brush thumps)

198
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:11,336
(laughs) I hit the bucket there.

199
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:13,932
There you go, just beat
the devil out of it.

200
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,320
All right, I usually run the brush

201
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,581
across a little paper
towel, just to make sure

202
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:22,283
it's as dry as I can possibly get it.

203
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:23,687
You don't wanna go up and touch

204
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,841
the canvas with a wet brush.

205
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:30,023
There, keep your canvas and your paint

206
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:31,937
as thick and firm as possible.

207
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,822
One of our golden rules is a thin paint

208
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:36,273
will stick to a thick paint, so you wanna

209
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,207
keep this as thick as possible.

210
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,562
I'm gonna take a little
white, a little black,

211
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:46,197
make just a touch of
gray, something like so.

212
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,802
Little roll of paint again,
we'll always load the knife,

213
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:51,387
that little roll of paint.

214
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:53,193
I don't want very distinct things today,

215
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:55,701
just want the indication
of little things happening.

216
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,463
No pressure, absolutely no pressure.

217
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,386
Just let it float right across there.

218
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:05,221
Just wanna give some indications,

219
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,005
but not a lot of detail.

220
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,027
Don't worry about it, just a little.

221
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:13,486
Sometimes we put a lot of indications,

222
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:16,850
sometimes a few and it's
really and truly up to you.

223
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:18,962
You decide what's in your world.

224
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:22,237
There, see make this
little bump right there

225
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,449
and you can take a little of this,

226
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,794
give it a little pull, but I don't

227
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:27,943
want it to be real distinct,

228
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,663
just sort of a quiet little place there.

229
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,071
There, that easy, no
pressure on the knife.

230
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:38,520
I know I say that over
and over in the shows,

231
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,625
but it's probably the
single biggest mistake

232
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,514
people make when they first start

233
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:46,695
is applying too much
pressure on the knife.

234
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:50,310
Then it looks just like
you were icing a cake.

235
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:54,294
And that's all right, but
it really looks better

236
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:56,267
if the paint sort of breaks and by break,

237
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:59,110
that just means it has holes in it.

238
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:05,732
And that's done by just a gentle pressure,

239
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,634
very, very gentle pressure.

240
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:13,189
All right, something about like that.

241
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:20,452
And we can sorta just rub it
a little bit, blend it out.

242
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,466
Once again, I don't want a
lot of detail in this one,

243
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,712
clean, dry, brush, and
I'm gonna tap the base,

244
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:33,806
following the angles here.

245
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,265
Always follow those angles and just

246
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:39,650
blend it a little bit,
just blend it, blend it.

247
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:43,094
Bring it together, like so.

248
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,482
That's all there is to it.

249
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:51,557
All right, now then, tell you what,

250
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,016
we'll just take, that little
brush working pretty good.

251
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:56,037
We'll just take that same mountain color,

252
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:58,266
same old mountain color,
sort of a lavender.

253
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,697
We'll tap a little bit right
into that two-inch brush.

254
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,161
Don't be afraid of this
brush 'cause it's large.

255
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,060
It'll do wonderful things.

256
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:08,686
Now then, let's decide, yeah there we go.

257
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,925
Maybe right in here
there's a little foothill,

258
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:15,246
lives right here, just a little footy hill

259
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:17,753
right at the base of the mountain.

260
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,707
Just tap in the basic shape
that you want it to be.

261
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,796
Maybe something about like that,

262
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:25,699
it doesn't matter, it's up to you.

263
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:31,326
There, see there, now very gently

264
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:34,843
grab it and lift up, tiny
little strokes though,

265
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:37,754
short little strokes and do it in layers.

266
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,238
It'll give the impression of distant trees

267
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,371
that live far away, they live right

268
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,274
at the base of this old mountain.

269
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:47,248
What a view they would have.

270
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,432
Little touch of that color, and we can

271
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:52,106
go right in here and give the indication

272
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,478
of a little reflection of that, that easy.

273
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:56,937
Now then let me get a clean brush.

274
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:58,723
I have several of each brush here.

275
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,586
I wanna create the
illusion of a reflection

276
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:02,767
on this, that we dropped in here.

277
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:06,927
Normally we'd pull down,
this time, pull up.

278
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,872
And I'm beating the brush
just to remove excess color

279
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:14,430
'cause you're gonna pick up a little color

280
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:17,305
and that will remove it, see there?

281
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:19,758
All there is to it.

282
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,990
Now, very lightly, go across

283
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:26,173
and that'll give the indication

284
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:29,121
of an instant reflection, that easy.

285
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,464
All right, now then, let's have some fun.

286
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:37,846
We'll take, we'll just use
that same mountain color,

287
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:41,245
so we had some blue and some black

288
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,510
and some crimson, I'll
put some brown in it

289
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:47,990
and some sap green, basically
all your dark colors.

290
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:53,633
Some sap green, all right,
let me clean the ol' knife.

291
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:59,024
Now then, let's grab
us a little fan brush.

292
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:01,535
There's one, number six fan brush.

293
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:04,347
Take a little color, just put a little

294
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:06,021
bit of color right on the brush.

295
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:07,712
That's all there is to it, kay?

296
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,955
Now maybe, let's see if that shows up,

297
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,168
might have to make it a little lighter

298
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,255
to get it to show, so we'll add

299
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:17,759
a little white, just a
little touch of white.

300
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:20,543
Yeah, that's a little better.

301
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,713
Now then I'm just gonna take and grab that

302
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:25,157
and lift upward, want it to look

303
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,892
like little trees, little closer to us,

304
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:31,700
but living very far away, very far away.

305
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:34,702
Just touch it, all you're doing

306
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:36,163
is putting a little line of paint

307
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:39,357
and then you lift it upward,
could not be simpler.

308
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:44,307
There, there, that's all there is to it.

309
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,097
We'll take the knife, little bit

310
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,942
of dark sienna and Van Dyke brown,

311
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:51,187
mix it together, maybe
a little white with it.

312
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:55,015
There you go, that's a
nice color, I like that.

313
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,347
Just sorta play around with color

314
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:58,669
'til you get what you want.

315
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,777
A little roll of paint and
let's go right up in here.

316
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:06,145
And with that, we'll
just put the indication,

317
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:08,806
maybe like, right there, see?

318
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,789
See, I'm sorry, I get excited.

319
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:13,687
I've painted like this for 20 years

320
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:16,166
and I still get excited
when I see it work.

321
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:20,471
So wonderful, I was a traditional painter

322
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:23,510
for many years and I now
call that my agony years

323
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,829
'cause I agonized over paintings.

324
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:31,157
Little bit of liquid white and we'll

325
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,504
just cut in a little water line,

326
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,355
just a little tiny water line.

327
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,219
This is sort of a light area that

328
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,813
separates the two darks.

329
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,819
There, now if you put a little

330
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,322
too much liquid white on there,

331
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:47,252
and you think it's a little too strong,

332
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:50,543
just rub it, it will just
be absorbed into the color.

333
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:53,606
It'll go away, no problem at all.

334
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,462
There, all right, that gives us

335
00:15:57,462 --> 00:15:59,355
a pretty nice little background.

336
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,110
Let's see, we need to figure out

337
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,536
what we're gonna put
in here, so let's take,

338
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:08,481
let's take (laughs), crazy time,

339
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,908
we'll take some more of that.

340
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:14,263
We got some Prussian blue, sap green,

341
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,341
crimson, brown, we'll mix up a pretty good

342
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:19,467
pile of paint here, let's play a little.

343
00:16:20,402 --> 00:16:24,737
All right, here's ol' two-inch brush.

344
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:28,853
We'll take him, load a lot
of color into the brush.

345
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:32,592
And we have to sorta make
some decisions in our world.

346
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,517
Let's just block in some areas.

347
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,659
Now then, maybe in our world, we're

348
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:40,927
gonna have a big tree
that lives right here.

349
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:43,258
We're not looking for
a lot of detail here.

350
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,685
All we're doing is blocking
in some basic shape.

351
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,058
This is sort of your bravery test

352
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:49,541
after you've worked so hard to

353
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,269
put in all those gorgeous things.

354
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:53,264
Then you come up here, some crazy,

355
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,440
fuzzy-haired guy says, "Put a big tree

356
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,108
right over the top of it."

357
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:00,713
But that's all right, there.

358
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,798
We'll decide where that goes later.

359
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,837
Maybe, we'll grab a little fan brush.

360
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,630
We'll have some more fun here.

361
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:12,530
Take a fan brush, load it
full of that dark color.

362
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,648
Maybe there's some little, maybe there's

363
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:16,733
a little peninsula right here, yeah.

364
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,710
When you paint, you begin to see things.

365
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:22,728
Let them happen, just let them happen.

366
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,599
Let them happen, don't worry about them.

367
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,208
Learn to compose as you paint.

368
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,336
Learn to take advantage of what happens.

369
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:34,354
We call those happy accidents

370
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:36,913
and they can be your best friend.

371
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:40,674
There, maybe, yeah, maybe it comes

372
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:44,542
right on down, right in there,

373
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,657
about like that.

374
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:51,812
We don't even know where
it goes over there,

375
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:53,737
don't think we care at this point.

376
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:59,407
All right, just wanna create a little mist

377
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:01,364
down here at the base and we can do that

378
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:04,430
with a clean brush, like so.

379
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,913
Then lift slightly upward, sort of

380
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:09,740
brings everything together.

381
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,279
There, course right underneath that,

382
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,125
we'd need a reflection, we
would need a reflection,

383
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:20,476
so just pull it straight
down, straight down.

384
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:22,839
It's most important that
it goes straight down.

385
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:24,882
Reflection should be as dark as

386
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:27,159
the object that's casting the reflection.

387
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,635
There, and then go across.

388
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,705
Give us a little instant reflection.

389
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:38,609
Now, maybe, tell you what, maybe

390
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:40,283
there's a tree that lives right here.

391
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:41,447
We'll put some highlight
on him so he'll show.

392
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:43,643
This one lives a little closer to us,

393
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:46,102
so we can make out a
little more detail on him.

394
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,123
There, just a, he's got a friend.

395
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,634
Happy little tree, lives right here,

396
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:54,463
watches everything happen.

397
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:59,067
All right, now I'll go right into

398
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:02,794
a little touch of the
cadmium yellow, yellow ochre.

399
00:19:03,503 --> 00:19:05,956
Sooner or later, I'll hit all the yellows

400
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:07,312
and a little bit of the red.

401
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:09,577
I wanna make a nice green color

402
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:13,311
because you had blue
and black on your brush,

403
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,511
when you go in here,
you'll get green instantly.

404
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:18,028
Now then, we can come right along in here

405
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,759
and place just a few little
highlights on this tree.

406
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:23,437
That'll snatch it right
out from that background.

407
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,218
Little more color and we'll put a few

408
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:29,122
highlights on this little rascal.

409
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:32,775
Maybe in our world here, maybe there's

410
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:35,276
a few little grassy things
that we're beginning to see,

411
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,526
don't want a lot of detail yet,

412
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,844
just a few little things far away.

413
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,974
Little sparklers, there they go.

414
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,632
We don't know where they go over here,

415
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:51,648
don't know where they go.

416
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,605
Take a little bit of our
brown and white we used.

417
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,597
And we can put the indication of

418
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,269
a little land mass here, see there?

419
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,215
That simple, little bit of land.

420
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,164
Little touch of the liquid white

421
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,366
just to give the indication
of a water line right in here.

422
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:12,342
Don't want a lot of color,

423
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,403
just a little here and there.

424
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:17,729
See how that works, it's neat, huh?

425
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:21,537
Now then, we gotta decide
where this big tree lives.

426
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,955
Here he comes, here he comes.

427
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,914
He comes right on down,
this is just dark color.

428
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:30,794
Just a lot of dark color.

429
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:35,072
Maybe, maybe he comes
all the way down here.

430
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:38,048
I don't know, that's the
beauty of painting like this.

431
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:40,785
You really don't have to know exactly

432
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:43,285
where everything's at, it just works.

433
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,816
Little paint thinner, liner
brush, that brown color.

434
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:49,307
Here and there and there and here,

435
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:52,414
we'll just put the
indication of a little limb,

436
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,314
little trunk lives in there.

437
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:57,625
Don't have to worry about it very much.

438
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:01,763
Let's take, we'll use some of that yellow,

439
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,731
greens, mix them on the
two-inch brush though.

440
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,801
Let's go right in here and let's just

441
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,885
begin picking out some highlights.

442
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:15,885
There, just the corner of
the brush, all you're using.

443
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,154
There you are, now if you've got

444
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,146
a very thick, dry paint up on the canvas,

445
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,754
you can put this right on here.

446
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,818
It'll go right on the top
without mixing together.

447
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:29,980
But the paint on your brush has

448
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,135
to be a little bit thinner than

449
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:34,667
what you have on the canvas already.

450
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,355
It'll always pull toward
the thickest area.

451
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,287
There we are, now our yellows are made

452
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:44,119
just a little bit thinner,
so that works automatically.

453
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,783
There, maybe on down like that.

454
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:49,019
Now I'm gonna change
the flavor a little bit,

455
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,288
add a little bright red,
a little yellow ochre.

456
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:55,818
Maybe, yeah you're right, right there.

457
00:21:56,497 --> 00:21:58,172
There's another little tree, bush,

458
00:21:58,172 --> 00:22:00,625
whatever you wanna call it, wherever,

459
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,242
we're still just using
the corner of the brush.

460
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,547
That's really all there is to it.

461
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:08,870
And I'm gonna dip the brush into

462
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,778
a little touch of paint thinner,

463
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:12,318
wanna make it just a little thinner.

464
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:16,038
I'm gonna go over several
layers of paint here.

465
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:19,457
There, but if you add paint thinner,

466
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:21,840
add the smallest,
smallest amount possible.

467
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:25,466
You don't need much, don't need much.

468
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:28,560
Tell you what let's do,
let's have some fun.

469
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:31,620
Clean off a little spot to work here.

470
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,617
Even with my palette this
big, I still run out of room.

471
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:39,118
We're gonna take black, brown,

472
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:42,040
mix them together.

473
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,179
Now then, over here I'm gonna take

474
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:50,980
a little bit of white and
black to make a gray color.

475
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,042
There, something about like that.

476
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:59,715
Kay, now, we're gonna take
and add paint thinner to this.

477
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,007
I want to make this very thin.

478
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:04,734
As we mentioned earlier, a thin paint

479
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,643
will stick to a thick paint.

480
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:09,747
So now, I wanna show you an easy way

481
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:13,139
of making a fantastic effect, but

482
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:14,849
we need to thin these colors.

483
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:17,874
But if we hadn't started with a very

484
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,214
thick, dry paint, this wouldn't work.

485
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:22,769
So be sure you, I hate to keep

486
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,694
talking about the paint,
but it is important.

487
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:26,972
I get so many letters from people

488
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,604
that say they're having problems and

489
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:31,506
when I begin to talk to them, the problem

490
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:35,713
usually evolves from starting
with paint that's very thin.

491
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:39,328
Start with thick paint, then
each layer gets thinner.

492
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:44,512
Today, let's use a little oval brush.

493
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,148
I'll go through the dark color,

494
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:51,221
through the dark color, both sides.

495
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,122
Now one side, one side only,

496
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:55,803
I will put it in the light color.

497
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:57,119
So you got dark and light.

498
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,471
Now watch, watch, you can make

499
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,825
the indication of little stones

500
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,758
all in one stroke, like that.

501
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:08,676
That easy, that easy.

502
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,590
Now, pull a little
reflection down, like so.

503
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:17,451
Come across, go back to our little brush

504
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:19,765
that has the grassy color on it.

505
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:22,720
Put in a few little
highlights here and there,

506
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:25,835
just a few little duders.

507
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:30,384
Now, back to this and maybe

508
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:33,076
there's a little, yep, little
stone lives right there

509
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,002
and wherever you want them,
you just drop them in,

510
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:41,109
several little stones, put
some little grassy things.

511
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:45,076
Right around here, look at there,

512
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:46,640
see it brings it all together,

513
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,489
little yellow ochre in there too.

514
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:52,328
Just brings it all together, makes it fit.

515
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:58,269
There we are, now this
little rascal out here,

516
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:00,958
pull down a little touch of reflection.

517
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:04,658
Go across, take our small knife

518
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:08,142
and we'll put just the indication

519
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,232
of a little water line here and there,

520
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:14,130
sort of bring it all together,
just to bring it together.

521
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,148
Shoot, I think we got a
finished painting here.

00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:19,544
Really hope you've enjoyed this

523
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,187
and hope you'll join us for the rest

524
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,023
of this television series
and from all of us here,

525
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,092
I'd like to wish you happy painting

526
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:27,687
and God bless, my friend.
