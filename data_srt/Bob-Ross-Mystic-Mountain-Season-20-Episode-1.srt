1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:04,205
(instrumental music)

2
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:31,708
- Hello, I'm Bob Ross, and
I'd like to welcome you

3
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,289
to the 20th Joy of Painting series.

4
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,890
Son of a gun, it's hard for me to believe

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,045
this is the 20th series,
but it is, and I'd like

6
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:40,060
to thank you very much
for inviting me back

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,225
for another series of painting shows.

8
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:43,944
If this is your first time with us,

9
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,809
let me extend a personal
invitation for you

10
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:47,846
to drag out your brushes and your paints

11
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,564
and paint along with us each show.

12
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:50,887
I think you'll enjoy it.

13
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:52,060
Tell you what, let's start out today

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,404
and have 'em run all the colors

15
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:55,527
across the screen that you
need to paint along with me.

16
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:57,724
And I think we'll just do a
happy little picture today.

17
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,643
So, let me tell you what
I've got done up here.

18
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,821
We have our standard old
18 by 24 inch canvas,

19
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:05,338
but you use whatever size you want.

20
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:07,664
And we have it covered with
a little bit of liquid white,

21
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:10,960
just a thin, even coat, just
enough to make the canvas wet.

22
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,602
And with that, we'll just take off,

23
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,724
and we'll have a super time.

24
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:16,686
Start today, I think we'll
use a little one-inch brush

25
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:19,920
and we'll go into a
very, very small amount

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,591
of the phthalo blue.

27
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:22,691
Just a little bit.

28
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:23,864
Don't want much.

29
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:25,451
And let's make some, let's make

30
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,191
some happy little clouds in our world.

31
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:28,684
Let's come right up here.

32
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:31,159
And, we'll just take this brush,

33
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,316
and we'll just bounce in some nice shapes.

34
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:36,299
Now, when we're doing
this, we're interested

35
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,219
in the white area, not the dark.

36
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,438
So don't worry about the dark area.

37
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:42,539
We're gonna blend that all out.

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,182
All we're doing is putting in some color

39
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:46,478
for the shadows of our clouds.

40
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:48,696
And this is one of the
nicest, easiest ways

41
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:51,429
of making very effective,
great big ol' clouds.

42
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:52,847
There.

43
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:55,706
See, we're interested in
this white area, once again.

44
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,466
Maybe there's another little cloud

45
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:00,921
that lives in our world,
right along there.

46
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,161
Wherever you think they should be,

47
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:07,365
then that's exactly where they should be.

48
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:08,888
Just wherever.

49
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:10,445
And just use the old
little one-inch brush,

50
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:13,219
and just, I'm making tiny little circles.

51
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,126
Just tiny little circles.

52
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,561
There we are.

53
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:20,542
Okay, maybe I'll add a little
color right in here too.

54
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:22,606
Just so there'll be a little color

55
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:24,152
at the base of this cloud.

56
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,432
There.

57
00:02:25,432 --> 00:02:26,807
Now then,

58
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:28,343
let's take our little brush,

59
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:31,031
this is a two-inch brush,
and go right up in here,

60
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:34,349
and very gently, I'm using
just the corner of the brush.

61
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:38,072
We'll make little, round
circle patterns here,

62
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:41,667
just sort of wind it
up, blend it together.

63
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,383
Allow it to blend with the white

64
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:45,911
that's already on the canvas.

65
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:49,271
And that's the joy of this
wet-on-wet painting technique.

66
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,108
The fact that it's wet
allows you to blend color,

67
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:53,548
right on the canvas.

68
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,926
Right on the canvas.

69
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,526
There you go.

70
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:59,882
Now, it's beginning to
make a little sense.

71
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:03,675
See how those dark areas end
up being the nice shadows

72
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:07,297
and the white areas will
end up being our clouds.

73
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:11,010
This is a great way to make
clouds for seascape paintings.

74
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,781
Just great, big, fluffy clouds.

75
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:14,074
Works very nice.

76
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,400
There we are.

77
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:19,508
Now then, while we have
this old brush dirty,

78
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:20,672
tell you what let's do.

79
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:23,765
Let's go back into a little
bit more of that phthalo blue.

80
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:25,049
Phthalo blue is a very nice color,

81
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,127
it's a very warm blue.

82
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,358
I like that.

83
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,954
Just a little color on the brush.

84
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:31,471
Okay, let's go back up here.

85
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:33,049
Let's have some water in this painting.

86
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,968
If you've painted with me before,

87
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:37,251
you know I'm a fanatic for water.

88
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:38,824
I love water.

89
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:41,710
And it's one of the nicest,
easiest things to paint

90
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,304
in this technique.

91
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:46,147
And today, maybe this
one will be still water.

92
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:49,530
So we want these lines to be
basically straight across here.

93
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:54,384
Cause as you know, still water
is always flat, always level.

94
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:56,688
There.

95
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,778
Now, just very lightly,
go all the way across,

96
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:02,015
and sort of bring it together.

97
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:04,954
and that light area here,
it'll remain in there.

98
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:06,469
There.

99
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:08,497
Okay.

100
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,944
Now, the most fun part

101
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:13,247
of this whole technique
is washing the brush.

102
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:14,144
So let's do that.

103
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:17,472
We wash our brushes with odorless thinner.

104
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,526
Shake off the excess.

105
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,998
(laughs) And just beat
the devil out of it.

106
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,813
This is where you take
our all your frustrations

107
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:29,137
and hostilities and just have a good time.

108
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,835
Let's go into a little titanium white.

109
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,052
We'll use the old fan brush.

110
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,492
We'll make some little clouds.

111
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:36,752
I'll be right back, let me
grab the least little touch

112
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:38,555
of the bright red.

113
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:39,952
Just enough, a little bit more.

114
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:40,816
There.

115
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:42,555
Just enough to put a little pinkish glow

116
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,706
into our little clouds.

117
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:46,966
Don't want much, don't want much.

118
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:48,342
Okay, let's go up here.

119
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:50,688
Now we gotta make big decisions.

120
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,779
We'll just use this brush and decide

121
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,788
where our little clouds live.

122
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:58,206
And, we just come along here
and sort of drop 'em in.

123
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:01,604
This also works very well
with a little one-inch brush.

124
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:03,661
Very well.

125
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,242
Either way that you wanna do it.

126
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,139
Either way.

127
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:11,004
If you haven't painted with us before,

128
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,711
one of the things that we try to do here,

129
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:15,934
we try not to teach you just to copy.

130
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:18,791
All we're trying to do
is teach you a technique

131
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,141
and turn you loose on the world.

132
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:25,341
We use no patterns, no tracings.

133
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,700
All we do is sort of
have an idea in our mind,

134
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,579
and we just sorta let it happen.

135
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,043
And if you'll practice this a little bit,

136
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,102
very soon you can enjoy the freedom

137
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:39,941
of creating a painting
right on the canvas.

138
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:41,562
Right on the canvas.

139
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:44,418
And to me, that's where
it really becomes fun.

140
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,355
It's when you can
literally create a painting

141
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:50,248
right on the canvas as
you're working on it.

142
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:54,141
You look at what you're
doing, and you'll see things.

143
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:56,495
They'll just sort of happen.

144
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:58,756
And you learn to take
advantage of whatever happens

145
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:01,899
and use it to make your painting special.

146
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,429
And you can do that.

147
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:07,478
Okay, let's go back,
(bangs brush on easel)

148
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:10,100
get our old two-inch
brush, and I just wanna now

149
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,769
blend all that together.

150
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:13,899
Just blend together.

151
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,415
I'm being careful not to
touch these top edges yet.

152
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,795
I'm just blending the blue and the white

153
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,140
down here together, very gently,

154
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,930
still using little circular strokes.

155
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,147
There we go.

156
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:27,817
Just sort of let that mix together.

157
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,193
I'm getting very close to the top,

158
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:31,822
but I'm trying not to
touch it at this point.

159
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,416
Very close, but not touching.

160
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,323
There.

161
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:36,894
A little bit up in here.

162
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:38,915
See?

163
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,281
Just sorta blend it together.

164
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,341
Mix it up, just like you're
making a cake or something.

165
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,764
Just mix it up.

166
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:48,711
A little bit in here, right there.

167
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,107
Okay.

168
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,341
Good.

169
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:56,016
But this is a beautiful way. (bangs brush)

170
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,927
I just beat the brush like
that to knock off excess paint.

171
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,615
It's a beautiful way to
create a very effective,

172
00:07:01,615 --> 00:07:03,574
big, fluffy clouds.

173
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:05,899
Now we're just sorta lifting it up.

174
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,072
This will blend it all
together, smooth it out.

175
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:11,792
There.

176
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,670
See there?

177
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,961
And then, very lightly,
two hairs and some air,

178
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:21,377
just gently, gently, gently
blend the entire sky.

179
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:23,382
And with that,

180
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:26,308
shoot, we have a pretty
nice looking little sky.

181
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:28,411
And there wasn't anything to it.

182
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:31,572
Now then, let's get crazy.

183
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:34,975
Let's take, we'll use some midnight black,

184
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:36,201
little Prussian blue.

185
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,879
Now, Prussian blue is much
darker than phthalo blue,

186
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,938
it's strong, whew.

187
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:42,175
Very strong color.

188
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,913
We'll put some Van Dyke brown,

189
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:46,313
a little Alizarin crimson in there too.

190
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:48,276
But we're looking for a very dark color,

191
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:49,625
it should look black.

192
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:51,775
Pull it out as flat as you can get it,

193
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,715
and go straight down with the knife,

194
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:55,540
and we'll just cut off
a little roll of paint.

195
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,414
There it is.

196
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:57,800
It's right out at the edge of the knife.

197
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,154
Let's go up here.

198
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:01,960
Now, I want to make some
tiny little mountains

199
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,884
up in here, that are far away.

200
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:06,078
I don't want these to be very big,

201
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:09,548
because we wanna create the
illusion of distance here.

202
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,812
Using a very firm pressure,
just literally push this

203
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:16,802
right into the fabric.

204
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,391
And I don't want a lot of mountains today,

205
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,220
that's about all we need.

206
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:27,324
With a two-inch brush, I'm
gonna grab this and pull it.

207
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,963
Just pull it.

208
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,742
It does two things, removes excess paint

209
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:35,092
and it blends all this together.

210
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:37,665
There we go.

211
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,326
Now, when we're painting
mountains, as you know,

212
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,042
you always want the top of the mountain

213
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:44,325
to be more distinct than
the bottom of the mountain.

214
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,980
Because at the bottom, we have mist

215
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,966
and now we have wonderful pollution,

216
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:52,144
and we have all these things that break up

217
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:54,500
and diffuse light, and
it creates this softness

218
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,525
at the base of the mountain.

219
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:58,381
Let's go into a little titanium white,

220
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,613
what the heck.

221
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:01,368
Very small amount.

222
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:04,957
Get a very, very small
amount of paint on the knife.

223
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,066
Now then,

224
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,950
barely touch, no pressure.

225
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,133
No pressure.

226
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,968
And I don't want this to be very distinct.

227
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,993
I want this to be very quiet,

228
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:17,493
subdued, far away,

229
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:20,081
gentle, soft.

230
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:23,557
Think about those types of words and stuff

231
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:25,039
when you're painting, and it'll help

232
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,289
your hand go much more gentle.

233
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:31,747
But very soft.

234
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:33,783
Don't want a lot of detail in this.

235
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,733
And we'll take a little
bit of blue and white,

236
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:40,534
and just the indication of some shadows,

237
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,704
don't even want a lot of shadow back here.

238
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:46,586
Too much detail will ruin
that illusion of distance.

239
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:50,484
Just enough, just enough

240
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:53,684
to give the feeling that
there's a nice mountain

241
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,427
living back in there.

242
00:09:56,778 --> 00:10:00,274
Now with a clean, dry
brush, following the angles,

243
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:02,823
always follow the angles,

244
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:04,754
we're gonna very gently,

245
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:07,696
very gently tap it and
then lift it upward.

246
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,189
And that'll help also
create that illusion of mist

247
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,857
at the base of the mountain.

248
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,875
Shoot, let's get crazy.

249
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,121
Find another one-inch brush.

250
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,924
Or you could use your fan brush, whatever.

251
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:21,790
Take a little bit more
of the titanium white.

252
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,470
Maybe in our world, maybe
this old cloud right here,

253
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,114
it just sort of drift right
down in front of the mountain.

254
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,417
So, just a little white.

255
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,679
Little circles, tiny little circles.

256
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:37,989
Shoot, maybe there's one right here.

257
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,179
I don't know.

258
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,531
I don't know, just sorta
look at your painting

259
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:43,354
and make a decision.

260
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,335
Maybe it just sorta wraps
this old mountain up.

261
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:52,684
We'll take a two-inch brush
and just blend it together.

262
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,991
This is a super way of making mountains,

263
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:58,174
that look like their just
laying out here in the mist.

264
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:01,298
I lived in Alaska for many, many years,

265
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:04,245
and you see some of the most
beautiful scenery there.

266
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:07,719
God was having a good
day when He made Alaska.

267
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:08,992
Beautiful.

268
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:10,571
Beautiful.

269
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,956
There, see that old mountain just lays

270
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,065
up here in the mist
now, and floats around,

271
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,734
has a good time all day.

272
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,611
Now then.

273
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,345
Maybe we'll have some
little foothills back here.

274
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,408
I like to do little foothills.

275
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,899
And we'll take some of
that same mountain color,

276
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,474
add the least little
touch of sap green to it.

277
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,826
Little sap green, there we are.

278
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,797
But it's predominantly blue.

279
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,451
The one that's farthest away here,

280
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,951
we'll make predominantly blue.

281
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:38,143
Okay, let me wipe my knife off.

282
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,726
And let's use, we'll use a
one-inch brush, what the heck.

283
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,495
You could use your fan
brush or two-inch brush,

284
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,789
it doesn't matter.

285
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,357
Load a little color in there.

286
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:49,754
And let's go right up in here.

287
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:52,611
Now, we have to make a big decision.

288
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,892
Where does our little foothills live.

289
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:55,620
Maybe we'll have one
coming right over here.

290
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,390
We'll start this one out back here,

291
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,118
just using the corner of the brush

292
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,598
and pulling straight down, gently.

293
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:07,033
Maybe a little foothill
comes right over like that.

294
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,349
Wherever.

295
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:12,632
Once again, this is a
very individual thing,

296
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,178
painting is.

297
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:15,082
So,

298
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,343
just sorta look at it
and make up your mind

299
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:19,450
how you want your painting to be.

300
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,739
Now then, when you're doing the foothills,

301
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:24,021
especially layers of foothills,

302
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,920
you want a little misty area in between,

303
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,264
that's your separator.

304
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:29,823
So take the brush, two-inch brush,

305
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,600
and just tap the base of it.

306
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,966
And you can tap quite firmly.

307
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:38,096
You can probably hear how hard
I'm hitting the canvas here.

308
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:42,139
And then, very lightly, just
lift it upward a little bit.

309
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:44,602
There.

310
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:48,513
Okay, now then, maybe we'll
have several layers in here.

311
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,413
When you're doing landscapes, each layer,

312
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:54,346
each plane, as it comes closer to you,

313
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:56,374
should get darker in value.

314
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:58,699
So we'll use that same
color, and I'll just add

315
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:00,116
a little bit of that mountain color.

316
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,279
See, it's right here, I'll just add

317
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,495
a little of that into it.

318
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:03,903
That'll make it a little darker.

319
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,561
Maybe a touch more of the green.

320
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:06,985
There we go.

321
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:08,085
Okay.

322
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:12,309
Now, maybe over here, we'll
hold the brush up like this.

323
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:15,786
And that'll make tops
that are a little taller,

324
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:16,863
a little more distinct,

325
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,916
cause they're getting
a little closer to you.

326
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:20,941
There.

327
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:23,197
But you can create just layer after layer

328
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:24,763
after layer like this.

329
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,004
And it enhances your painting tremendously

330
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:31,145
because it creates that illusion of depth.

331
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,437
Back to our two-inch brush,

332
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:36,122
and once again,

333
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:39,855
once again, we wanna create that mist.

334
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:42,576
See how that mist in between separates?

335
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:44,014
It's your best friend.

336
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:45,544
Take care of it.

337
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:47,625
Take care of it.

338
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:49,288
There we go.

339
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,272
Now lift upward.

340
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:54,722
And maybe,

341
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:56,034
I'll tell you what,

342
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,242
let's have one more.

343
00:13:58,243 --> 00:13:59,201
Let's have one more.

344
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,227
I'm adding a little
more of that dark color

345
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:03,576
right into that same original pile.

346
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,894
One more.

347
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:09,586
And then, maybe it lives right here.

348
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:11,713
But it's darker in value.

349
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,751
It's a little darker.

350
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,798
There we go.

351
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,327
And we'll let him come,
maybe, right down in here.

352
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,591
I don't know.

353
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:25,291
There.

354
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,293
But each layer, each layer
needs to get darker in value.

355
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:34,162
To keep that feeling of
distance in the painting.

356
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:35,985
And I know I repeat that over and over,

357
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:37,951
but it's so important.

358
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:39,907
So important.

359
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:42,208
You don't want just a flat old painting.

360
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,375
Shoot.

361
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,653
We want a masterpiece here.

362
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,098
And you can do that.

363
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:51,902
Once again, we're gonna tap that base,

364
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,283
just like so.

365
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,790
Very lightly, lift it upward.

366
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,083
There.

367
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:03,451
And maybe, we're
beginning to get down here

368
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,191
to where there are a few reflections,

369
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:07,377
so we'll take a little
paint on the two-inch brush,

370
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:10,094
grab it and pull it straight down.

371
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:13,497
It's most important that these reflections

372
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,187
come straight down.

373
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,149
Most important.

374
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,939
If you go at an angle like
this, it won't look right.

375
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:23,000
See, even there, it doesn't look right.

376
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,903
Now very lightly, go across.

377
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,075
Very, very lightly.

378
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:31,275
Just enough to blend it and
give it the feeling of water.

379
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:33,717
It's one of the nicest
things about this technique,

380
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:36,206
it's instant reflections. (chuckles)

381
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:40,273
Now then, we'll take a
little of the liquid white,

382
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,543
put the least little touch
of the bright red in it.

383
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,060
Just, least little touch.

384
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,066
Just enough to flavor it a little bit.

385
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:51,562
Be careful, because very quickly,

386
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:54,826
this can get really intense in color.

387
00:15:54,826 --> 00:15:56,362
Now we just cut across.

388
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:57,440
That's all there is to it.

389
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,985
Go up here,

390
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:02,024
and we'll just put in, just the indication

391
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:05,288
of a happy little
waterline that lives here.

392
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,389
Now, if you get one that's maybe

393
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:09,373
a little too strong or too bright,

394
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:11,868
just go back and rub it.

395
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:14,556
The more you rub it,
the lighter it'll get,

396
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,612
because it'll just be absorbed

397
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:17,478
right into the color that's underneath.

398
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,870
No big deal.

399
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:21,767
And if you've painted with me before,

400
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,600
you know without question

401
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,317
that we don't make mistakes here.

402
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,654
We just have happy accidents.

403
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:31,125
But you learn to use
anything that happens.

404
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,747
Okay, maybe, right there.

405
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:36,346
And, little ripples.

406
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:39,514
But notice how all these
lines are basically straight.

407
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:41,072
If they're not, it's gonna look

408
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:43,067
like your water's gonna run
right outta your painting

409
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,548
and get your floor wet, and you'll have

410
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:46,658
to tie a bucket on one side. (chuckles)

411
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,486
We don't want you to have to do that.

412
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,019
Now,

413
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,807
tell you what.

414
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:53,740
Clean off a little spot.

415
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:59,996
Let's take some black, Prussian blue,

416
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:02,916
brown, crimson, sap green,
all those same colors,

417
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,927
but with no white in it.

418
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:08,221
So very, very dark.

419
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:09,413
Very dark.

420
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,748
Looks black on the palette.

421
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,044
There.

422
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,812
Okay, let me clean my knife.

423
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:18,835
And I just wipe the knife
on an old paper towel.

424
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:22,307
Find a fan brush here.

425
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:26,829
Let's take the fan brush,
and go right into that color.

426
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,186
Load a lot of paint onto the brush.

427
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:30,092
Both sides.

428
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:32,910
See, the bristles are, there's
a lot of paint in there.

429
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,648
Okay, let's go up here.

430
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:37,549
Maybe back in here, in
our world, there lives,

431
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:39,652
well there does now, anyway,

432
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:43,575
there lives a happy little evergreen tree.

433
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:46,900
And we just use the corner of the brush.

434
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,667
Just the corner,

435
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,855
and as you work down the tree,
add more and more pressure

436
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:53,115
so that the bristles bend downward

437
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,382
much, much more.

438
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:55,714
Look at there.

439
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,441
Isn't that a nice way to make
a happy little evergreen?

440
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,520
Let's give him a friend.

441
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,682
You know me.

442
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:06,028
I think everybody, everybody
should have a friend.

443
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:08,879
Friends are so important.

444
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,174
There.

445
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,653
Alright.

446
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:14,509
Maybe, shoot.

447
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,777
In our world, maybe
there's three trees here.

448
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,136
You can put as many or as few as you want.

449
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:23,904
The only thing that we
would like to teach you here

450
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,472
is how to make a tree.

451
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,809
You decide how many trees
you have in your world.

452
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,088
Maybe we'll have some,

453
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,806
maybe there's a little
reflection down here.

454
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:32,950
Just put some general shapes,

455
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,913
we're not looking for detail.

456
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:37,829
Not looking for detail.

457
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,640
Just very basic little shapes.

458
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,557
Shoot, who knows?

459
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:42,593
Maybe there's some land there too.

460
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:44,365
You can just push up with the fan brush,

461
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:48,752
a little bit down for the reflection.

462
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:52,404
And let's take, we'll use
the old two-inch brush,

463
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:56,244
and grab this, decide
where water and land meet,

464
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:58,441
and pull straight down once again.

465
00:18:58,442 --> 00:18:59,868
Straight down.

466
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,201
Son of a gun.

467
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,559
Instant reflections.

468
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:04,353
Go across,

469
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:06,663
and that easy.

470
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:07,846
That easy.

471
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,808
And see, these reflections,
you can push 'em.

472
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,568
See how you can push 'em?

473
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,566
Because the canvas is
wet, you can do that.

474
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,480
You can do anything here.

475
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,082
Oh this canvas, you have
total and absolute power.

476
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,025
Unlimited power here.

477
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:24,944
(laughs) When I go home,
the only thing I can do

478
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,319
is take the garbage out.

479
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,769
But here, I can do
anything that I wanna do.

480
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,240
Let's take a little of the
dark sienna and a little white,

481
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,988
get a little roll of paint on the knife,

482
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,208
and let's put a little
indication here and there

483
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,344
of a little tree trunk
that lives in these.

484
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,328
There.

485
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:41,846
Don't want a great deal.

486
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:44,081
Don't want a great deal, just enough to

487
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,915
Just enough to indicate
there's something in there.

488
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:50,070
And you can just take
the point of the knife,

489
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,833
and just scrape through and
make little lines and sticks

490
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,436
and all those little things.

491
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:57,173
Tell you what, let me
grab another fan brush.

492
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,238
I have several of them going here.

493
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:02,016
And let's take and go
into a little yellow,

494
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:03,392
this is cad yellow,

495
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,085
a little touch of that color
we made the tree out of,

496
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:09,059
since it has blue in it, as
soon as we touch the yellow,

497
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:11,911
turns beautiful green color.

498
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,268
Maybe a little yellow ochre too.

499
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:16,432
I want a dark green here.

500
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,834
Once again, load the bristles quite full.

501
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,315
A lot of color.

502
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:21,596
Let's go up here.

503
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,586
Now then,

504
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:25,460
let's put some highlights
on these little trees.

505
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:27,956
Don't wanna overdo.

506
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,851
If you put too much highlights on here,

507
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:33,643
too many highlights, then it

508
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,357
loses it's effectiveness.

509
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:38,137
We want these to be quite dark.

510
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,416
Look at there.

511
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,535
And that's all there is to it.

512
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:42,115
Darker, darker, darker.

513
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,521
Now, maybe down here, there's

514
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,811
some little grassy
things that grow on this.

515
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:48,740
And you can just make those

516
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,846
by pushing up with the brush, that's all.

517
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:52,480
Very easy.

518
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,074
Now.

519
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:55,576
Let's have some land under there.

520
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:57,037
We need something to hold those trees up

521
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:58,894
so they don't fall over in the water

522
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,717
and make a big splash.

523
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,719
There.

524
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,633
Little Van Dyke brown, little
dark sienna mixed together.

525
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:08,932
Like so, we'll take a little
touch of that brown and white.

526
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:14,510
Just make the indication
of a little land there.

527
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:18,105
Little bit of the liquid
white that we had left over.

528
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,783
And we'll just put in a little waterline.

529
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,459
This waterline is your separator.

530
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,913
It's a light between two darks,

531
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,036
and that separates it, and makes it,

532
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:31,163
makes it stand out.

533
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:32,330
Alright.

534
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,653
Tell you what, we'll
just use this big brush.

535
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:37,318
Ready to have some fun?

536
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,215
If you've painted with me before,

537
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,954
you know that I love to make big trees.

538
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:42,775
So let's do that.

539
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:45,336
I'll use the old two-inch brush today.

540
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:46,998
The old two-inch brush.

541
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:49,323
So often we avoid this
brush because it's big

542
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:50,561
and we're afraid of it.

543
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,723
A lot of paint.

544
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:52,981
Wiggle.

545
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,484
Wiggle, wiggle,

546
00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:56,459
then sharpen it, just
like you would a knife.

547
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,549
Look how sharp this brush is.

548
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:59,903
There, you can see.

549
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,663
It's very sharp.

550
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:03,093
Let's go up here.

551
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:06,069
Now then, maybe in our world
lives a big evergreen tree.

552
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:07,188
Right there.

553
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:09,012
Just touch the canvas.

554
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,028
Now, we use just the corner.

555
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:13,247
Just the corner of the brush.

556
00:22:14,414 --> 00:22:16,500
And just go back and forth,

557
00:22:17,656 --> 00:22:18,947
and begin laying in

558
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:21,455
all of these beautiful
little limbs and stuff

559
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,240
that live here on this tree.

560
00:22:24,112 --> 00:22:25,065
There.

561
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:26,558
Okay.

562
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,441
Tell you what,

563
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,562
we'll have another one.

564
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:32,003
You knew that, didn't you?

565
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:34,716
You knew I'd have a friend out here.

566
00:22:36,163 --> 00:22:37,234
There.

567
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:39,836
Okay.

568
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:41,326
Now then,

569
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,905
let's have some, maybe
there's some big, leafy trees,

570
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,028
not evergreens that live here.

571
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,292
There.

572
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,882
Let's just push in some,

573
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:54,346
push in some nice leaf and branch shapes.

574
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:55,535
Look at there.

575
00:22:56,949 --> 00:23:00,351
And when you use a big brush,
you can do this very rapidly.

576
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:02,389
Now, let's go on the other side.

577
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:03,870
We need some over here too.

578
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:06,111
Now, you can do this with a
one-inch brush if you wanted to.

579
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:07,466
Works just as well.

580
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:08,648
Just as well.

581
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,543
This is just a little bit faster.

582
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:13,147
A little bit faster.

583
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:16,164
There we are.

584
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,079
Okay.

585
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,311
Just bring it right on
down, right on down.

586
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:24,346
Now you have to start
making big decisions.

587
00:23:25,194 --> 00:23:27,379
Okay, we'll just put it there.

588
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,085
A nice bush lives there.

589
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:31,922
Tell you what, let's get crazy.

590
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,413
Maybe.

591
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,443
Maybe it just goes all the way across.

592
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:40,151
In your world, you can do
anything that you want.

593
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,871
If you want this shrubbery
and bushes and trees

594
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:45,034
to come all the way across, then do it.

595
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:46,030
Do it.

596
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:47,793
Alright.

597
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:50,093
Now then, we can just take a clean knife,

598
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:54,119
and just make the indication
of little sticks and twigs,

599
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,651
just by scraping, just
the point of the knife.

600
00:23:57,606 --> 00:23:59,260
We're gonna cover most of those up,

601
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,413
but some of 'em will show.

602
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,013
We can even use a little brown and white,

603
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:04,010
come right up in here,

604
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,031
put the indication of a trunk.

605
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:09,369
Not a great deal of detail, just a little.

606
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,707
Little over here.

607
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,976
Cause these are gonna be
deep in the old tree here,

608
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:16,625
you're not gonna see much of them.

609
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,225
But they're there.

610
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:20,583
Now then, let's take,

611
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,344
we'll dip the brush into a
little of the liquid white.

612
00:24:23,344 --> 00:24:25,124
One-inch brush.

613
00:24:25,124 --> 00:24:26,544
We'll go right through,

614
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:31,288
I'll use a little cad yellow,
grab some sap green up here.

615
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:32,430
There we are.

616
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,948
Cad yellow, sap green, pull
the brush in one direction,

617
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:36,569
load a lot of color in it.

618
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:38,168
Okay, let's go up here.

619
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,222
Now then, think about all your
little leaves and stuff here

620
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:44,227
that would just shine and,

621
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:46,467
oh, they would sparkle out here in the sun

622
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:48,114
under this big mountain.

623
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:52,053
And when you're painting,
make up little stories.

624
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:54,661
Think about the scene
that you're painting,

625
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,006
become part of it.

626
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:58,064
Make friends with a tree.

627
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,546
Shoot, you can just
drop all this stuff in.

628
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:02,785
And let it go.

629
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:04,989
Darker, darker, darker as you work down

630
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:06,269
toward the base of the tree, though,

631
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:07,528
darker, darker.

632
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:09,874
Add a little yellow ochre here or there,

633
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:12,615
a little Indian yellow sometimes, just

634
00:25:12,615 --> 00:25:15,222
just to change the flavor.

635
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,586
Wherever you want 'em.

636
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:18,837
There we are.

637
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:21,650
Little touch of bright
red even, here and there.

638
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,314
It's up to you.

639
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,758
Up to you.

640
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,422
There.

641
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,828
And you choose even the time of year.

642
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,135
Let's go on this other big tree over here.

643
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,850
Maybe over here, there lives,

644
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:36,843
there lives this big tree.

645
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:40,144
Think about individual shapes and form

646
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:42,060
inside of this tree.

647
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,820
Don't just throw it on at random.

648
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,519
Think about, think about
the limbs inside the tree

649
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,262
that give it shape and form.

650
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,203
There.

651
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:52,322
Okay.

652
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:53,537
Darker, darker, darker,

653
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:55,040
down here toward the base.

654
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,623
Much darker.

655
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,808
Let's have a bush right here
that has red flowers on it.

656
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:02,157
Look at that.

657
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,687
See there?

658
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:06,568
Just by putting a little bit
of red on the end of the brush,

659
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:07,919
you can do that.

660
00:26:08,722 --> 00:26:10,226
Here lives another one.

661
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:12,446
Just do one bush at a time, though.

662
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,273
One at a time.

663
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:16,034
There they go.

664
00:26:17,522 --> 00:26:18,668
Okay.

665
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:21,153
Just wherever you want 'em.

666
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,788
Shoot.

667
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,682
It's coming along pretty nice.

668
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:27,200
There.

669
00:26:29,425 --> 00:26:30,135
Okay.

670
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:31,991
And the other side, over here,

671
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,876
we'll put in some little bushes here.

672
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:38,050
And you can use the brush sidewards.

673
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:41,383
Just push upward and create
all kinds of little things.

674
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:43,760
Just like so.

675
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:46,096
Alright.

676
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:48,011
I'm gonna put a little path in here,

677
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:50,134
use a little Van Dyke brown,
we got just a second left,

678
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:51,810
so I'll throw that in.

679
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,330
A little brown and white.

680
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:56,744
Give this indication of a little path.

681
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,374
Then all we need to do
is put a little bush

682
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:01,700
over the top of it, and
it sets it right down

683
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,417
into the painting.

684
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,399
Shoot, I think we have
a finished painting.

685
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,886
With that, I'm gonna
wish you happy painting,

686
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:10,450
and God bless, my friend,
I'll see you next show.

687
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:15,110
(instrumental music)
