1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:02,870
- Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,865
Certainly glad you could join me today.

3
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:06,413
You know, we get hundreds and hundreds

4
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:09,282
of letters here concerning
the Joy of Painting.

5
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:11,490
And one of the things we
here over and over again

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,626
is people feel intimidated,
or they're a little nervous

7
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:17,442
about putting the first stroke on canvas.

8
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,788
So, I thought we'd devote
this entire show today

9
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:22,199
to teaching you how to
just sort of loosen up,

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,897
and take life easy, and enjoy painting.

11
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:26,443
We're gonna use a very limited palette,

12
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,725
and maybe I'll just use
something like a two inch brush

13
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,698
and maybe a palette knife.

14
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,875
Very simple, but I wanna
show you how to get

15
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,755
over this fear of your first painting.

16
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:37,109
So, let's have them run the colors

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,869
that I'm gonna use across the screen.

18
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,330
And let's just have some fun today.

19
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,144
Just drag out the old easy chair,

20
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,192
and get you a big glass of iced tea,

21
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:46,420
and kick back, and sort of enjoy this.

22
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,765
If you have your paintbrush out,

23
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:49,439
I invite you to paint along with us,

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,900
and I think you'll enjoy doing something

25
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:52,287
that's a little different.

26
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,049
It's very free, very
relaxed, and it gets you over

27
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,857
this tightness, or this
fear of your first painting.

28
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:02,462
So, I'm just putting a little
Liquid White on the canvas.

29
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,576
And basically here, all we're
looking for is just a nice

30
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:08,756
thin even coat, of the liquid
medium all the way across

31
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:10,004
the canvas.

32
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:12,466
This just makes the canvas wet and slick.

33
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:14,462
It's what allows color to blend on here,

34
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:16,457
and maybe we can really demonstrate today

35
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:19,335
how color blends on this Liquid White.

36
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:21,085
Now, this is a pre-stretched canvas.

37
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:22,963
It has give to it.

38
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:25,566
It's not a canvas board,

39
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:27,337
we don't recommend those.

40
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,099
Because they have cardboard in the center,

41
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,883
and what happens, they'll
absorb this Liquid White,

42
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:35,527
and very rapidly your
surface will become dry.

43
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,224
And it's no fun to paint on it anymore.

44
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:40,200
Because this is wet you
need it to stay that way.

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,608
All right, let's take
a little Yellow Ochre,

46
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:43,218
and I'm just gonna play today.

47
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:44,305
Let's just have fun.

48
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,372
A little Yellow Ochre.

49
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,599
Be right back, don't go away.

50
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,362
Little touch of the black into it.

51
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:50,503
Very little.

52
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:53,522
And we just make a light
little color, like so.

53
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:56,679
And we still have Liquid
White on the brush.

54
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,076
So, we're just letting that blend.

55
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,344
We're gonna make a very soft,

56
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:01,628
maybe a little muted
area in the background

57
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:02,811
back here.

58
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:06,501
And just play with color.

59
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,932
You know, maybe one of the hardest things

60
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,575
to do in painting is to

61
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:12,786
is to get over this fear of canvas.

62
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,269
It's natural.

63
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,242
And if it bothers you a
little bit to jump up here

64
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:19,612
and start throwing a bunch
of color on the canvas,

65
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:20,818
it means you're normal.

66
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:23,378
You're just like me and everybody
else that's every painted.

67
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:27,101
You go through this until
you get over this fear.

68
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:28,540
So, that's what we wanna

69
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,628
we wanna play with.

70
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:32,435
Then, we'll take a little
touch of the Prussian Blue.

71
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:35,336
So, this begins to get a
slight greenish hue to it,

72
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:36,914
but not much,

73
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:38,609
not much.

74
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,077
And let's just begin playing with color.

75
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:44,998
Just play, maybe we ought
to decide what season

76
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,724
it's gonna be, at least,
before we get too far involved.

77
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:52,135
And maybe something in the winter colors

78
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:54,225
that's always fun.

79
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,021
A little bit more of the Prussian Blue,

80
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:58,739
and black.

81
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,115
A little touch of Yellow Ochre,

82
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:03,266
but mostly just blue and black.

83
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:06,483
And just let these colors
sort of blend together

84
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:08,936
and play, and have fun.

85
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,944
But really and truly don't worry about it.

86
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:14,726
The way to learn how to paint

87
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:18,604
is to be relaxed and
enjoy, and just let it go.

88
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:20,615
Things work better for
you when you're relaxed,

89
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:23,347
and you're really happy
with what you're doing.

90
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,853
So, try to let it happen that way.

91
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:29,586
Maybe on this side, we'll
put a little bit more of that

92
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,208
there.

93
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:34,908
See, we just sort of let these
colors come together here,

94
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:35,858
like so.

95
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:36,945
But very loose.

96
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:38,801
Very loose.

97
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,991
There.

98
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:42,033
Okay.

99
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,317
And we let them go wherever.

100
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,782
Doesn't matter.

101
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:48,484
There we are.

102
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,900
But see, that easy.

103
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,639
You have a very nice little sky.

104
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,569
One of the best ways to do this,

105
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,403
nearly every time you do a painting

106
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,049
you're gonna have a
bunch of color left over.

107
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:02,676
This is a super, super way
of using up that old color,

108
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:07,176
and enjoying the freedom of just painting.

109
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:10,194
And just letting your
imagination run wild with you.

110
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:11,495
So, try this.

111
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,352
I'm serious, there's
nothing that I know of that

112
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:17,459
will teach you looseness more than this.

113
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,199
I want to make this side over
here a little bit darker.

114
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,153
See, and as you begin painting,
you begin seeing things.

115
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:26,514
All these little things
just sort of happen.

116
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,936
So now automatically we have a light area

117
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,228
over in here.

118
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,201
Just because we made these
sides a little darker.

119
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,367
I'll make it even a little
darker yet, what the heck.

120
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,105
This is our world, so we can do it any way

121
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:38,343
that we want.

122
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:41,769
We'll just make a little
cross criss strokes.

123
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:44,596
We'll do it backwards today.

124
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:45,524
There.

125
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:48,387
And very lightly, I'll just
sort of blend that out a little.

126
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,704
And we have all kinds of
things happening in this sky.

127
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:54,004
That simple.

128
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,829
And if you wanna blend it more,

129
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,990
just continue to blend.

130
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,627
You can make it as soft as silk or velvet,

131
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:01,536
just by doing that.

132
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:02,976
And maybe in our world,

133
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:05,344
maybe way back here in the background

134
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:08,800
maybe we can visualize
some little distant tree

135
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,728
indication.

136
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,307
Just take the brush, lay it like that,

137
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:13,439
give it a little gentle push.

138
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,019
But I want these to be very soft,

139
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:15,978
and very light.

140
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:16,810
Far away.

141
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,620
See?

142
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,105
Now, the other side.

143
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,271
These are just little indications
of things that are far

144
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,013
back here in the distance.

145
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:26,142
Far away.

146
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,486
Don't let them get too distinct.

147
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:31,466
Or you'll ruin that illusion
of distance in your painting.

148
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,364
And we're just gonna play here.

149
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:34,302
Enjoy this.

150
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:35,230
Let it go.

151
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,065
Let it happen.

152
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,216
Let it happen.

153
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:41,331
Maybe there's another one right there.

154
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:42,259
I don't know.

155
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,509
Wherever you wanna.

156
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,909
But this is mainly a
little Midnight Black,

157
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,158
a little Prussian Blue,

158
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:50,366
and there's a touch of
Yellow Ochre left in it.

159
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:53,128
You can add maybe the least
little touch of Van Dyke Brown,

160
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:55,475
but the color should be
very soft and very muted

161
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,747
at this point.

162
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,699
Very soft and quiet.

163
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,352
Maybe this one goes way up here.

164
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:02,812
We don't know.

165
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,455
Just push harder if you
want it to look like

166
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:07,688
it's a bigger tree.

167
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:10,635
But this background idea is a way

168
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,838
to make very soft scenes that

169
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:16,055
you wanna show a lot of distance in.

170
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:19,122
And it's a very, very simple and effective

171
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,032
Okay, a little more of
the color on the brush.

172
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:26,605
Tell you what, maybe there's
a tree that lives right here.

173
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,346
Maybe this one, maybe this
one is sort of crooked.

174
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,850
And it goes all the way off the canvas.

175
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,184
Who cares?

176
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,166
In your world, you can make
it any way that you want it.

177
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:41,037
These are just, once
again, distant indications

178
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,737
of things that are happening.

179
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,826
Very soft and muted, quiet

180
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:49,283
peaceful little places.

181
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,489
This is where all the little
creatures live and have fun.

182
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:55,346
There.

183
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:59,299
Some of them you can hardly see in there.

184
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,338
They're so far away.

185
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,158
There, maybe.

186
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,847
There we are.

187
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,541
Let's see, we said this
was going to be winter.

188
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,291
So, we need to keep that in mind.

189
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,189
I'll mess around here,
and forget what season

190
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,675
I said it was gonna be.

191
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:19,586
There we go.

192
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:22,861
Now then, down here at the base

193
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:25,411
we're still using the same colors.

194
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,202
The same ol' colors.

195
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,058
We can tap in a few little happy bushes

196
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,821
that live right down in here.

197
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,912
This is just a tiny bit darker.

198
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,577
So, it indicates that
it's a little closer.

199
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,433
Now, if this is our light source here

200
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,853
less pressure on the brush.

201
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:42,519
Let it get lighter, and lighter.

202
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,290
Very gentle.

203
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,489
Just sort of fade right into that.

204
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:49,558
Where you want it to be darker,

205
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,087
just get a little tougher.

206
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:53,954
Push,

207
00:07:53,954 --> 00:07:57,111
and let it go right off there somewhere.

208
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:59,320
There we go.

209
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,389
Maybe over in here

210
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,850
Tell you what, maybe

211
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,311
maybe there's a few little trees that,

212
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,942
yep you're right,

213
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:08,353
live right here.

214
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:11,240
Just little indications of little things.

215
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,466
See, and you can just turn the
brush in different directions

216
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,861
to create all types of effects.

217
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:25,764
There.

218
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:27,972
And just sort of look at it once again.

219
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,901
This is such a fantastic way of painting

220
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,459
because you have no

221
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,154
you don't trace a painting up here,

222
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:35,288
and you don't have any guidelines.

223
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:39,533
The only thing that restricts
you here is your imagination.

224
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,115
Just your imagination, nothing else.

225
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:44,911
And imagination is like anything else,

226
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,350
it's like a muscle in your body,

227
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,326
if you practice with it, you
exercise your imagination

228
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:51,203
it gets stronger.

229
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,688
Very soon, you're able to
visualize more and more things

230
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:55,682
in your mind.

231
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:57,933
So, use it.

232
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,885
God gave you this gift.

233
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:02,743
Take advantage of it.

234
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:04,418
We may be the only creature on Earth that

235
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,223
has a vivid imagination.

236
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:08,408
There.

237
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,104
Then again, we may not.

238
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:11,842
I don't know.

239
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,956
Don't know that it matters.

240
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,653
There.

241
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,295
And we'll start adding

242
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:21,899
Mmm, we'll take a little more
of the black, and the blue,

243
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,427
Van Dyke Brown, maybe a little
tough of the Dark Sienna

244
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:25,634
here and there.

245
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,543
But as we work forward, I
want this color to begin

246
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,697
getting a little darker.

247
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:31,649
And see, I'm just loading the brush

248
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,419
by just going back and forth.

249
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,968
Doesn't matter how you load it.

250
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:38,113
Doesn't matter.

251
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:41,494
There, a little blue, and
black, a little Van Dyke Brown.

252
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:44,267
All those beautiful, beautiful colors.

253
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,590
Now, then maybe

254
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,495
watch here.

255
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,917
See, all you gotta do is take
this brush and push upward,

256
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,538
like that to make.

257
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:52,192
Look at that.

258
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,018
See, that easy you can
make the illusion of little

259
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:56,992
grassy areas back in here.

260
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,346
Just like so.

261
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:04,706
Shoot, maybe we'll have some over here.

262
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:06,817
And we're gonna sort of
change the lay of the land

263
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:08,311
here a little.

264
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:11,863
So, it has some interesting
things happening in here,

265
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:14,162
it's not just all the same.

266
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,851
Let these little things just happen.

267
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,250
There.

268
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,192
All kinds of little doers.

269
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:27,287
Maybe over in here again.

270
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:30,125
See, you begin seeing these little doers.

271
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,586
But just pushing upward,

272
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:34,028
bend the brush very hard.

273
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:35,745
You're not gonna hurt the brush.

274
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,091
But it makes all these little
grassy looking effects.

275
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:40,639
They're very simple, and you can do them.

276
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,541
I know you can do them.

277
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,937
'Cause you can do anything
that you wanna do.

278
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,699
As long as you can believe you can do it.

279
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,388
Anything that you believe you can do,

280
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,456
you really can do.

281
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:55,099
Let's take a two inch brush.

282
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:56,379
And I have several two inch brushes,

283
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,860
so I don't have to spend
all of my time here

284
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,610
just washing brushes.

285
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,600
Just gonna pull through a little
bit of that Titanium White.

286
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,042
This is gonna be winter, maybe.

287
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:09,007
Maybe in our world there's a
little snow laying back here.

288
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:11,214
But I want the snow to
reflect some shadows

289
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:13,562
from whatever it is we have in here.

290
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:16,580
So, go up into the color
a little, and grab it,

291
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,020
and begin pulling.

292
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,088
Now, watch here, let's
just mess something up.

293
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,646
If you mess up the top of this one,

294
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:22,915
don't worry about it.

295
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,548
You can either completely wipe it out,

296
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:27,865
or you can go back and
very simply drop it in.

297
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:30,211
'Cause you know, if you've
painted with me before,

298
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,046
we don't make mistakes,

299
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:34,392
we have happy accidents.

300
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,504
Because there's nothing that
you can do on this canvas

301
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:39,288
that with a little practice you can't fix.

302
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:42,028
Think about the lay of the land now.

303
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:42,893
Watch here.

304
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,141
Let me grab this other old brush.

305
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,601
You can go right back in here.

306
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,413
See here?

307
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,884
And pop that right back in.

308
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:49,975
And that's nice because
now it looks like there's

309
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:50,966
snow behind it.

310
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:51,756
See?

311
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,889
These little things work for you.

312
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:56,651
See you could put one over here

313
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,402
like that.

314
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:02,038
See, and it looks like
there's snow back in there.

315
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:04,268
There, and you can make
this just as smooth

316
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,636
and peaceful.

317
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:10,026
Maybe, we'll grab that.

318
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:11,937
See, we got quite of bit of color there.

319
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:15,004
That's nice, that'll make
a very nice shadow area.

320
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,769
There, and just sort of bring it together.

321
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,923
This old two inch brush will just do

322
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:24,790
wonderful things for you.

323
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,596
Just fantastic things.

324
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:30,432
Now, already though look
at the depth in here.

325
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,309
And you've really done nothing.

326
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,517
You've really done nothing except just

327
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:36,161
take a two inch brush and play a little.

328
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,400
Let's take that same color we're using,

329
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,586
take a little paint
thinner on the liner brush.

330
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:44,117
Maybe we'll have a few little
sticks and twigs in there.

331
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:45,344
Maybe a few.

332
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,616
Just pull this out.

333
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:51,711
Turn it, so it brings it to
a very sharp point, okay.

334
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:53,984
Now, we want these to be
very subdued and quiet.

335
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:56,213
We don't want these to be too bright.

336
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:57,466
Too strong.

337
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,982
Very subdued.

338
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,860
There, a few little things
that live back in here.

339
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,609
Ooo, that's what I'm looking for.

340
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,041
You almost can't see
them, but they're there.

341
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,372
They're there, you'll see them.

342
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:16,316
There.

343
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:19,638
See?

344
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,774
And just pick out where you
think a little twig would live,

345
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:25,057
and drop it in,

346
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:26,812
drop it in.

347
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,297
So, now I mentioned we get
a lot of letters from people

348
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:33,965
who are a little nervous about
trying their first painting.

349
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:37,315
We also get a lot of letters
from people who are painting,

350
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:39,267
and they're doing some
of the most fantastic

351
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:40,526
things imaginable.

352
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:42,871
Maybe in this series we'll show you some.

353
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:44,930
But people who have never painted,

354
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:48,067
just from watching the
show have picked up a brush

355
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:50,039
and they're doing marvelous things.

356
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,504
And maybe more important
than the painting,

357
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:55,586
is the fact that they can do it.

358
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:59,426
Is the fact that you can
achieve a creative process

359
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:00,535
like this.

360
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:02,562
And it's a nice way of

361
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:05,442
oh, I think everybody has sort
of an urge to be creative,

362
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,629
and it's a nice way of
letting that urge come out

363
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,498
and it's so enjoyable.

364
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:12,386
That's one of the reasons
we like to show you.

365
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,795
Shoot, let's get crazy I
talk too much sometime.

366
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:18,626
Let's go back into some
of our blue, and black,

367
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,649
get a little brown, be right back here.

368
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:24,259
Well, see I'm gonna have
a little more brown,

369
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:25,634
a little Dark Sienna.

370
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,490
I may even reach over here
and get the least little

371
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,698
touch of Alizarin Crimson.

372
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:31,809
Oh nice, nice.

373
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,612
Now, if your color gets too dark on you,

374
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:34,872
or you think it's too dark,

375
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:36,748
you can reach right over
pick up a little white,

376
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:37,846
and lighten it up.

377
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,958
Because you can do anything.

378
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,537
Let's load the brush up.

379
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,019
Tell you what, let's
load it to a chisel edge.

380
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,110
Let's really have some fun.

381
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,596
Chisel edge, turn it
around here so you can see

382
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,014
how sharp that is.

383
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,172
See, it comes to a
beautiful sharp chisel edge.

384
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:53,238
There we go.

385
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,094
But you must put enough
paint into the bristles

386
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,773
to stick the bristles together
to make the chisel edge.

387
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,426
Let's go back up here.

388
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:03,330
Maybe in our world there
lives a little tree,

389
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,258
or a big tree.

390
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:06,434
Maybe this is a big tree.

391
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,918
And we can, if it helps, you
can put in a little center line

392
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:10,379
like that.

393
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,918
Get a little more color here.

394
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:16,076
Now then, think about
where you would have nice

395
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:17,206
branches living here.

396
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,510
Just take the corner of the brush,

397
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,438
and just put out a branch here and there.

398
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:25,879
Just let them go.

399
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,576
Just let them go.

400
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,805
And maybe they aren't all just even.

401
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,615
Maybe these aren't all
potential Christmas trees.

402
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:35,662
They're just trees that grew any way that

403
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:38,243
they wanted to grow.

404
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:41,358
All evergreen trees are not
gonna be Christmas tress,

405
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,052
some of them's gonna be crooked,

406
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,164
some of them's gonna be sort of,

407
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:47,948
they gonna be sort of poor.

408
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,221
There.

409
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:52,642
A little more paint.

410
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:54,797
Now, just to have a general
idea of where we're going,

411
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:58,653
and let's just take the corner
of the brush, once again.

412
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:02,264
There.

413
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:05,407
Just tap in some very basic little shapes.

414
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:08,855
There we go.

415
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:11,258
Maybe even we can see a little
touch of the trunk here.

416
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:12,932
Who cares?

417
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:17,156
This is your world, you do it
any way that you wanna do it.

418
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:20,387
So, maybe this tree had
a bad year right in here.

419
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,047
It didn't grow too hot.

420
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:26,201
Maybe when he was little

421
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,922
maybe some hungry creature decided to chew

422
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,682
on him a little bit.

423
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:32,175
We don't know.

424
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:34,425
Don't know that we even care.

425
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,282
Okay, now as the trees come closer,

426
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:38,115
they should get a little darker.

427
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:39,994
So, I'm gonna add a little bit
more of that Prussian Blue,

428
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:43,545
and a little Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna.

429
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,872
But they begin taking on a darker tone.

430
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,033
Black, blue, brown.

431
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:51,716
There we are.

432
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:55,097
Sounds like my body condition
when I stay out too late.

433
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,009
Black, blue, and brown, that's
what I get when I get home.

434
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,270
There we go.

435
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,126
Maybe in our world there
lives another little tree,

436
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:03,711
right there.

437
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,763
Okay.

438
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,886
We'll just let these little
trees just fall right

439
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:11,974
off the brush.

440
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:13,692
Wherever,

441
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,483
wherever.

442
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:17,520
Doesn't matter.

443
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,383
Black, blue, and brown.

444
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:22,490
This one goes all the way off the canvas.

445
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,647
What the heck.

446
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,064
He's a strong tall tree.

447
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:33,182
But if you practice this
painting very loose.

448
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,176
You will not believe, number one,

449
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:36,317
what you can do.

450
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:38,983
Secondly, it'll create a
looseness, and a freedom

451
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:42,259
in your painting that you've
never experienced before.

452
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:44,787
And I think you will find
that's very refreshing.

453
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:48,392
Very, very, refreshing in your painting.

454
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:51,688
I have a lot of people who
have painted for many years

455
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:54,685
that take classes with
me, and my son Steve,

456
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:57,350
and the other teachers that we have,

457
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:00,668
and they take classes
in this technique mainly

458
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,366
to learn to be loose with their painting.

459
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,616
Because it's very easy
to get tight, and stiff,

460
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,888
and used to staying in the lines,

461
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:10,885
and just drawing little pictures,

462
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:13,840
and following those.

463
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,171
This will give you freedom.

464
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:20,466
Absolute freedom.

465
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:22,417
There, let's go to the other side here.

466
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:27,131
Little blue, black, back
to our brown, Dark Sienna,

467
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:30,428
just mix them together.

468
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:31,804
There, wiggle that brush though

469
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:34,194
that brings the paint right up to the end.

470
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,783
We need to make it sharp.

471
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:37,032
All right.

472
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:40,348
Maybe look at what a
sharp line that is now.

473
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:43,281
See how sharp you can make that line?

474
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:46,028
Now then, just the corner of the brush.

475
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:50,660
Let's put in some little
things here and there.

476
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,042
See that?

477
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:57,547
You can do this.

478
00:18:57,547 --> 00:18:59,541
You really can do this.

479
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,311
There.

480
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:02,986
Let's give him a friend.

481
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:04,331
You know me.

482
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,785
I think everything, and everybody

483
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:10,740
should have a friend.

484
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,086
Friends may be the most
valuable commodities

485
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,540
that we have.

486
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,660
Treasure them, take care
of them, treat them good.

487
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,540
There we are.

488
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:26,902
Now maybe, look just push upward.

489
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:28,064
See?

490
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:30,432
Maybe there's a whole
'nother thing that comes

491
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:31,893
right out like that.

492
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:34,260
Just by pushing up with the brush,

493
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,399
you can create that illusion.

494
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:40,353
Just by giving a little upward push.

495
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,653
Let's go back to the brush that has some

496
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:43,211
white on it.

497
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:46,134
And with that, let's come back in here,

498
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,595
and we lay in a little snow.

499
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:49,547
Once again, pick up some
of this color though,

500
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:50,784
and drag it out there.

501
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:52,224
Get tough with it.

502
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:55,423
Because the canvas is wet,
you can move this color.

503
00:19:55,423 --> 00:19:58,506
If this was a dry canvas,
you might be able to move it,

504
00:19:58,506 --> 00:20:01,278
but it would be very difficult
and you'd work yourself

505
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:03,258
half to death trying to do it.

506
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:05,706
There we go.

507
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,604
Maybe on this side, once again though,

508
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:09,930
figure out how the lay
of the land is here.

509
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,370
How the

510
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,135
how it flows.

511
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,957
And it's sort of nice to
have a little recessed area

512
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,024
right in here.

513
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,295
It just gives you a nice
place for the animals to walk,

514
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:22,363
and just good things to happen.

515
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,877
But any of these little
bushes and stuff here that

516
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:28,992
you don't like, you
just lay snow over them.

517
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:30,598
Just like nature does.

518
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:33,286
So there.

519
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:35,770
Look at that.

520
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,907
Now then, we can take
some of that same color

521
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,880
on our knife and here and there,

522
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:45,110
if you wanted to, you
could add the indication

523
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,968
of a little stronger trunk.

524
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,044
Depends on what you're looking for.

525
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:53,792
Once again, very loose,

526
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,514
very relaxed.

527
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:58,960
Just let it go.

528
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:01,874
This is fun painting.

529
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,759
There.

530
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,565
You know, this would be a super place

531
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,101
to have a little cabin.

532
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,029
Let's do that.

533
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,820
I think we have enough time.

534
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,209
And a lot of people have
problems with a cabin,

535
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,671
so let me show you.

536
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,780
Let's go right up in here.

537
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,782
Decide where your cabin lives,

538
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:19,692
and let's just scrape out
a very basic little shape.

539
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:21,057
Maybe we'll have a big cabin in here,

540
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:22,849
it shows up better.

541
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:26,684
See, just take the knife and
scrape out your basic shape.

542
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:30,871
Now, right there's where there
is where the stretcher bar

543
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,941
is don't worry about
that, we'll cover that up.

544
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:35,905
Now, one of the things
that you're looking for

545
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:38,488
when you're doing a cabin
is your perspective.

546
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,642
If you're gonna have a cabin, like so,

547
00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:42,871
one of the most important
things you can do

548
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:44,802
is have this part of the
roof a little bit higher

549
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,413
than the back.

550
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:49,612
Otherwise, it won't look right.

551
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,307
Try to keep that a little bit higher.

552
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:52,375
If you put that a little lower,

553
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,464
which is almost a natural tendency,

554
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:56,855
it'll look like your cabin is sort of

555
00:21:56,855 --> 00:22:00,246
well maybe the front of
it fell down into a hole.

556
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:02,038
I live in Florida, and sometimes there's,

557
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,958
we have sinkholes there.

558
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,281
And it almost looks like your
cabin fell into a sinkhole.

559
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,708
See there, all right.

560
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,724
Let's just put a little

561
00:22:11,723 --> 00:22:14,304
We'll just Dark Sienna,
and Van Dyke Brown,

562
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,759
mostly Van Dyke Brown.

563
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,189
And let's just lay in.

564
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:21,410
All I'm doing is laying in some color now.

565
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,096
Just laying in some color.

566
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:25,930
There.

567
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:30,884
You could do this with a cement
trowel, it doesn't matter.

568
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:33,573
A little something like that.

569
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:35,961
See, and the bottom at this point

570
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:37,379
don't be concerned with.

571
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,980
Because you can come along
here with your knife,

572
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,423
and do a cabin-ectomy,
and decide exactly where

573
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:43,439
everything should live.

574
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,071
That easy.

575
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,661
And maybe, we said this
was gonna be a log cabin,

576
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:51,683
or something that gives you
the impression of a log cabin.

577
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,560
So, we'll take a little brown, and white,

578
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,490
and let's just come along in here.

579
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,581
And think about this angle right here.

580
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:59,662
And let's just tap in
some little indications

581
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:01,912
here and there.

582
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:03,198
See there.

583
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:05,885
All right.

584
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,245
Okay, just drop it in.

585
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,060
There.

586
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,589
We can take that dark color
that we picked up earlier,

587
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:18,381
and go back,

588
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:20,660
and help create that illusion.

589
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:24,211
There.

590
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,930
Over in here, this is gonna
be very dark on this side.

591
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,581
We don't want much color over here.

592
00:23:31,737 --> 00:23:34,639
Think I'll put a tree
there, what the heck.

593
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:37,414
Put the indication of the end of the logs.

594
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:39,576
Just using the point of the knife.

595
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:42,491
That easy.

596
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:44,093
Maybe we got a door in here,
let's put a little door.

597
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:46,547
We gotta have a way to get in and out.

598
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:49,086
That's all there is to it.

599
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:50,649
Put in a little door.

600
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,929
A little light around the door.

601
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:57,929
Now, we need a little

602
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,908
Let's put a little snow
up here on the roof.

603
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:03,883
See there.

604
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:06,665
But just pull it down.

605
00:24:06,665 --> 00:24:08,023
Just pull down.

606
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:09,484
We said we'd have a tree in front of it,

607
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:11,201
so we don't have to
worry much about the back

608
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,292
of it at this point.

609
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:17,121
We do need a little bit
of snow over on this side.

610
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,119
Just so there's snow on both sides.

611
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:22,486
Now then, let me go back to my brush here.

612
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:24,300
Let's take, watch how
you can move the trees,

613
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,659
let's take some of our
brown, and black, and blue,

614
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,729
a little Dark Sienna.

615
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,520
Okay, and let's go back up here.

616
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,859
Now maybe, let's take
this tree right here,

617
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:36,256
right here,

618
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:37,505
and let's make a big decision.

619
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:39,830
This tree lives on this side of the cabin.

620
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:42,357
See, how you can change your mind?

621
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:46,356
You can pull this tree right over here

622
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:47,636
in front.

623
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,291
That easy.

624
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,422
That easy.

625
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,977
On this canvas, you have unlimited power.

626
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:55,916
Now then, maybe

627
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:59,147
See there a little
grass growing over here.

628
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:01,121
Maybe a little right in here.

629
00:25:01,122 --> 00:25:02,754
Whatever.

630
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:05,558
Let's take our brush with the white on it,

631
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:08,355
come right up to the bottom of the cabin.

632
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:10,288
There we go.

633
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,053
Put a little snow right in there.

634
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:15,917
Watch here, watch here, watch here,

635
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:17,015
touch, push.

636
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,941
Bend, bend the bristles.

637
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:21,943
Just do this in layers.

638
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:24,546
Continually in layers though.

639
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:25,846
Grab the bottom,

640
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:27,271
give it a little pull.

641
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,750
Like that.

642
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,876
See how that just all comes together?

643
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:35,565
Shoot, tell you what maybe,
maybe there's a little sprig

644
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:37,219
right here.

645
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,849
And that way it looks like
there's stuff behind it.

646
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:42,472
There.

647
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,963
Shoot, I'll tell you what,
let's go on the other side

648
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:45,933
over here.

649
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:48,910
Maybe over here, in our world there lives,

650
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,883
well there does now,

651
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,971
maybe there's a little doer
that lives right out here.

652
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:58,276
Now then, once again, take
a little Titanium White,

653
00:25:58,276 --> 00:26:00,810
grab that, and just let it flow.

654
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,577
See there?

655
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,071
That easy.

656
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,481
Maybe...

657
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,038
See, how you can break that up,

658
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:14,690
and it creates the
illusion of depth in there.

659
00:26:15,932 --> 00:26:18,087
Shoot, we messed around here,
and about have a painting

660
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:19,037
that's not half bad.

661
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,009
And I was just going to
show you how to relax,

662
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:22,887
and enjoy this.

663
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:26,033
But I really hope you
try something like this,

664
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:28,103
because it's a great deal of fun.

665
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:30,119
It teaches you how to use the equipment,

666
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:32,742
it gives you confidence with equipment.

667
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:36,198
And once you have the confidence,

668
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,916
then you can do anything.

669
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:40,102
You can do anything.

670
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:41,958
We'll put a few little
sticks, here and there.

671
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,633
There's one.

672
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:45,925
And you can just go
around it, here and there,

673
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:47,461
and tap in a few,

674
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,040
like that.

675
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,299
That's really all there is to it.

676
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,182
Wherever you think they should be.

677
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:56,082
And I think we'll call this finished.

678
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:57,800
I really hope you've
enjoyed this experiment,

679
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,749
and I hope you try it.

680
00:26:58,749 --> 00:26:59,698
Let me hear from you.

681
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:00,829
From all of us here,

682
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,937
happy painting,

683
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:03,314
and God bless.

684
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:07,904
(mellow guitar music)
