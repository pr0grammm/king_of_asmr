1
00:00:01,328 --> 00:00:02,778
- Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:02,778 --> 00:00:04,485
Certainly glad you could join us today.

3
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:07,686
It's a fantastic day here and
I hope it is wherever you are.

4
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:09,349
Tell you what let's get right on it today.

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:12,038
Let's start out and run all
the colors across the screen

6
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:13,865
that you need to paint along with us.

7
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:14,934
While they're doing that let me tell you

8
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,817
what I've got done up here already.

9
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,949
I thought today we'd do the
little opening that you see.

10
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:21,125
The painting that the little painter man

11
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:23,207
is wiping off with a big brush

12
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:24,752
and I want to show you
how that one was made.

13
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:27,951
So I've taken just a plain
old 18 by 24 inch canvas

14
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,956
and I've picked up some masking tape.

15
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:31,791
It was laying around the studio here and

16
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:34,984
I've just put one square
here and one square there

17
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:36,271
of just masking tape,

18
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,118
that's all it is

19
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:39,728
and I've covered the whole
canvas with a thin even coat

20
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:41,094
of the liquid white.

21
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:42,628
So it's all ready to go so

22
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:44,676
let's just have a good time.

23
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:47,789
Let's start out today with a
small amount of yellow ochre.

24
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,110
Very, very small amount
on the two inch brush

25
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,423
and this won't be an exact
duplicate of what you see

26
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:56,917
on the opening but it's close
enough you'll see exactly

27
00:00:56,917 --> 00:01:00,891
how it was made and then
you can do your own at home,

28
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,682
but just paint right
over the masking tape.

29
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:05,498
Just like it wasn't even there.

30
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,034
Just like so.

31
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:10,320
You had a little bit of
yellow up there in the sky.

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,139
There.

33
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,256
About like that, that's
all we're looking for

34
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,304
and this is just plain yellow ochre,

35
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:19,147
but it's blending with
the liquid white that's

36
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:20,257
already on the canvas

37
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:21,878
and all these fantastic hues

38
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:25,487
happen automatically, automatically.

39
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:26,826
Okay.

40
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:29,039
Tell you what,

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,771
I'm gonna grab another brush,

42
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:31,051
I have several of them
so I don't have to spend

43
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,971
all my time washing brushes

44
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:37,846
and go right into a small
amount of the midnight black,

45
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,335
don't need much, just a little,

46
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:42,000
just a little.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,828
Let's go back up here now.

48
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,608
Now over here we'll just take that black

49
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,203
and we'll just begin on
the other side of the sky.

50
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:53,179
Now once again this also is
gonna mix with the liquid white

51
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,763
and the black of course
is gonna become grey.

52
00:01:56,763 --> 00:02:00,981
So we have a grey sky with
a little bit of yellow in it

53
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,620
and that's all that's in that

54
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,762
sky that you see in the opening.

55
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:06,384
I like that opening
that little painter man

56
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:08,175
is so cute.

57
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:10,905
That was the idea of a
special friend that works here

58
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:12,954
at the station, Jerry Morton.

59
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:15,599
He put that thing together for us.

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,841
He's very talented and I
thank him for doing that.

61
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:21,225
There.

62
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:23,450
Okay, just blend these together
so you can't tell where

63
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,521
one color stops and the next color starts.

64
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,715
That's all we're looking for

65
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:31,086
and then very lightly,

66
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,902
very lightly go across the entire canvas

67
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:36,250
and that just removes the brush strokes.

68
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,066
Maybe blend a little more right there.

69
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,832
Okay great.

70
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,252
Something like so.

71
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,788
Now then, okay.

72
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,921
Let me wash the old brush here

73
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:52,591
and as you know we wash our
brushes with odorless thinner.

74
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,426
Shake of the excess.

75
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,771
Hm, just beat the devil out of it.

76
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:59,109
Oh I've got to show you something here.

77
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,100
I have to show you this.

78
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,423
A gentleman made this for me.

79
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:04,707
This is a cane that he carved and

80
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,662
it is unreal,

81
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:08,548
but he's actually put an image of

82
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,588
old Bob on the end of it here

83
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,088
and this was done by Mike Weaver.

84
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,948
He's one of our certified
instructors in Missouri

85
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:17,635
but as you can see he's
talented in many ways

86
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:20,366
but that's really
fantastic cane, isn't it?

87
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,819
I think he's trying to tell me something.

88
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:24,625
Okay.

89
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,359
Let's keep going here.

90
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,364
We'll take a little of the black.

91
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,558
Put a little mountain in here,

92
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,180
little black,

93
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,014
little touch of,

94
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:35,463
little touch of phthalo blue in there.

95
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,688
Maybe even a little alizarin crimson.

96
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,480
Pull it out very flat, cut across,

97
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,656
get our little roll of paint.

98
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:43,356
Now these little squares

99
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,813
we're going to play some games here

100
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:46,605
with different planes.

101
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:50,061
So I'm going to have a mountain
that projects above this

102
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,487
right here

103
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:54,073
and comes down.

104
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:56,377
Something like so,

105
00:03:56,377 --> 00:04:00,509
but I'm going to stop it right
here at this piece of tape.

106
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,197
There,

107
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:03,289
we'll let that come right on down

108
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:04,824
like so,

109
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:08,510
here's another peak right here.

110
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,840
Just wherever you think a
little peak should live.

111
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:14,844
That's exactly where it should be.

112
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:16,430
Right on down

113
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,689
and we'll stop it right
there at that piece of tape.

114
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:23,918
Okay a little color right under there.

115
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,439
Now we can take a clean
dry two inch brush,

116
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,189
and just grab that and pull it just like

117
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:33,091
we normally do to make a mountain.

118
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:33,944
There,

119
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:34,925
but I want to be careful not to let

120
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:38,125
that color go past the tape.

121
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,107
There.

122
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:40,685
If you like this painting
you can certainly do it

123
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:44,302
without the tape and it's
still a beautiful painting.

124
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:46,743
Or you could make your own designs.

125
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,560
These designs are very
interesting and people like them.

126
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,959
Try them.

127
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,295
It's very simple, you can do
it with tape or contact paper.

128
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,581
Just any old thing that'll
stick to the canvas.

129
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,458
Mm-hmm.

130
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,360
Now let's just take some titanium white.

131
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,403
We'll pull it out very flat,

132
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,474
cut across,

133
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,009
get our little roll of paint again.

134
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,185
Always have that little roll of paint.

135
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,757
Now we can go up in here and

136
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:12,557
just start laying on some highlights

137
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:14,264
right on this mountain.

138
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,141
Barely, barely touching.

139
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,455
Barely touching.

140
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:20,022
Just graze the canvas.

141
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,943
As I've mentioned before,
when I was teaching my son

142
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,641
Steve to paint,

143
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:26,627
I used to tell him just to
pretend that he was a whisperer

144
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,361
just floating right across the mountain.

145
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,469
It's that light.

146
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:33,718
It's that delicate of a touch.

147
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:35,553
You oughta see what kind of
mountains he's painting today.

148
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:39,734
Well you might of saw him on
some of the previous shows.

149
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,143
Does some fantastic mountains.

150
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,635
He does better mountains than I do.

151
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,812
Don't tell him I said that.

152
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:45,922
Let's take little white,

153
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:47,415
a little bit of phthalo blue.

154
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,634
Mix together.

155
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:53,175
and we use that for shadow color.

156
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:55,819
Okay, I just take little edge.

157
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,483
Let him go up in here

158
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,702
and maybe I'll just sort of
pull downward a little bit.

159
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,366
Make the indication of some little

160
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,927
ridges back here.

161
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,871
Sometimes it's fun to play
little games in your mountains.

162
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,430
Then we can come back here.

163
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,605
Just let all these little things happen.

164
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,749
Little touch up in here.

165
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:18,929
Just so we can see a little.

166
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,166
Now we know there's tape there.

167
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,195
Nothing's gonna show so we don't care.

168
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:27,158
We'll just bring that right across.

169
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,263
There

170
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,277
and wherever we need a shadow then

171
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:31,942
we can just lay it in.

172
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:34,024
Little touch right in there.

173
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,848
We'll push that little rascal right back.

174
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,682
That easy.

175
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:39,740
That easy.

176
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,949
On this canvas you have unlimited power.

177
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,144
Can do anything here.

178
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:46,867
You can change your world.

179
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:48,069
Anything.

180
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,629
Little white we just play
some games back and forth.

181
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:56,389
Let that just sort of float in there.

182
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,900
Wherever.

183
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:59,954
Now we take a clean

184
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:01,274
(beating brush)

185
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:03,536
and very dry two inch brush.

186
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,687
That's what all that beating was

187
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:07,503
I was just making sure it was dry,

188
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,936
and then very gently lift upward.

189
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:12,324
That'll help create that illusion of mist

190
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:14,543
down at the base of the mountain.

191
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:15,781
Over here.

192
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:18,341
This direction and lift upward.

193
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,644
Sometimes you can grab
just a little bit of that

194
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:21,796
and pull it.

195
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:24,570
Looks like a little
light has spilled over.

196
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,086
It's quite pretty.

197
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:29,838
There.

198
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:33,252
(brushing)

199
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,618
Okay.

200
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:35,728
Now then we're ready to start

201
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,562
putting some little footie hills in.

202
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:39,226
So for that,

203
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,323
take we'll just use

204
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:42,862
that same old mountain color.

205
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,824
Same old mountain color
with a little be right back.

206
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:46,531
A little bit of white in it.

207
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,366
Just wanna lighten it up,

208
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:52,072
but it's the same basic color.

209
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:52,688
There.

210
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,427
Let's go ahead up here.

211
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:56,570
Very simple little foothill.

212
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:58,192
We just have it come

213
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,983
right on down,

214
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:02,415
down, down, down.

215
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,392
Maybe, maybe right along there.

216
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:08,262
All we're doing is tapping with a corner.

217
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:09,115
Now but watch,

218
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,480
come back over this way.

219
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,247
Watch right here.

220
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,245
See I'm gonna let this go into this plane.

221
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:15,599
Notice the mountain stops here,

222
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,355
but this one is gonna
come through this plane

223
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:22,283
and on over.

224
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:24,117
This about as close to
an abstract painting

225
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:26,932
as I've ever done on television.

226
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:28,896
'Course I've made some mistakes at home

227
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,662
and we call those abstracts

228
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:31,642
but this is

229
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:33,514
the first one we've done intentionally.

230
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:37,531
I normally don't do paintings
that I have to explain.

231
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,215
There.

232
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:41,255
Okay, now let's have a little water

233
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:44,422
down here while we have
this color on here.

234
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:48,298
We can just come right in here.

235
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:49,540
Put in the indication of

236
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,912
a little bit of water floating around.

237
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:55,408
Something like so.

238
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:58,266
(brushing)

239
00:08:58,267 --> 00:08:59,419
There,

240
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:02,841
and this is just basic old mountain color.

241
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,793
(brushing)

242
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:08,827
Okay, a little bit on
the other side over here.

243
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:10,568
I'm gonna keep right in here.

244
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:13,353
I'm gonna keep it inside of this border.

245
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,221
(brushing)

246
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,232
There,

247
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:19,194
and maybe down here we'll let it slip out.

248
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:21,201
Something like that,

249
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,248
but just play games with different planes

250
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,382
in your painting

251
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,060
and you'll be surprised
at what you can create.

252
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:31,526
You will absolutely be amazed.

253
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:33,352
Now then,

254
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:35,572
same color.

255
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:37,590
We'll pull a little of that straight down.

256
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,064
Straight down,

257
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,642
and that'll end up being our reflections

258
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:44,672
under that little foothill back there.

259
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:48,939
Gently across, that easy.

260
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:52,953
Instant reflections,
that's sneaky isn't it?

261
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:53,520
There,

262
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,354
a little bit of the liquid white.

263
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:57,053
Pull it out as flat as you can get it

264
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:59,110
and then take a knife and just cut across.

265
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,029
That's all there is to it.

266
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:02,601
Then go up here and act just like you're

267
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,590
trying to cut a hole

268
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,998
right through the canvas

269
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:06,278
and this old canvas is tough,

270
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,086
you're not gonna hurt it.

271
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,492
Not gonna hurt it,

272
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,942
I don't think.

273
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:14,140
If you get out the butcher knife in your

274
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,087
kitchen you certainly can,

275
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,367
but this knife is dull,

276
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:18,715
you're not gonna hurt it

277
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,591
and right on over into here too.

278
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:24,133
We want it to be all the way over.

279
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,608
Okay.

280
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:29,295
Now gonna mix up a little more color here.

281
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,429
We'll use black.

282
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:33,237
Some phthalo blue,

283
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:34,907
maybe I'll put a little
Prussian blue in there too.

284
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,870
I'm gonna begin darkening this blue down.

285
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,475
Put a little alizarin crimson in there.

286
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:41,499
Something like so.

287
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,058
Least little touch of sap green.

288
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:45,338
Alright.

289
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,788
Okay let me wipe the old knife.

290
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:50,534
Now then,

291
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:51,610
shoot let's get crazy.

292
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,932
I'm gonna use the one inch brush today.

293
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,384
Fan brush should work just as well

294
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:57,788
but since I have it let's use it

295
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,418
and let's go in here.

296
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:01,380
Now this one stopped at that plane.

297
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,145
Let's have this group
of little distant trees.

298
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:05,681
They're bigger,

299
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:08,207
closer to us.

300
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:12,425
I remember they come right
down something like so

301
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:17,759
and we'll have these work their way.

302
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,787
Whew, there they go.

303
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:23,749
Right on up and right off the canvas.

304
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,403
So now each plane in the painting,

305
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:27,663
each layer of the painting has stopped

306
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:30,607
at a different point within this tape

307
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,293
and that's one of the things
that make this painting

308
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:36,167
so interesting when people look at it

309
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:38,907
and I guarantee if you paint this one,

310
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,192
people will look at it.

311
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:46,029
There, pull that down a little.

312
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,924
Now I wanna create mist right at the base.

313
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:51,914
All you have to do is just tap.

314
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:53,115
Tap it, tap it, tap it

315
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:55,547
all the way across and lift upward.

316
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,509
Upward, upward

317
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,812
and that'll create the illusion of mist.

318
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,250
Now then,

319
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,403
let's take,

320
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:07,878
I'm gonna add to that
same color we just had,

321
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:09,456
some brown.

322
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:12,008
Little bit of brown.

323
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,064
Little bit more of the black.

324
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:16,666
So it's a very dark color.

325
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,312
Okay tap a little of that in there.

326
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,701
Now I wanna have some land areas here.

327
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,152
I think the one that
you see in that opening

328
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:27,071
has land areas that come
right out like that.

329
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,442
So we put some dark in

330
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:30,149
only so our light will show.

331
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,389
You have to have dark
in order to show light.

332
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,908
It's just like in life.

333
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:38,128
If you don't have a little
sadness in your life,

334
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:41,370
you don't know when the happy times come.

335
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,769
There.

336
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,845
You know, while I'm doing this,

337
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:45,552
this is very repetitious,

338
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,769
I'm just gonna be putting
in some dark areas.

339
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,264
I wanna share a piece of video with you

340
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:51,013
from a young friend

341
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:52,591
that is just unreal.

342
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:54,212
This may be one of the youngest painters

343
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:55,535
that I've run into

344
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:58,137
and this young man's
name is Earl Glen Russell

345
00:12:58,138 --> 00:13:01,381
and he comes to us out
of Springfield, Missouri

346
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,221
and he is just a fantastic little painter.

347
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:07,182
I had the pleasure of
having dinner one night

348
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:09,615
with Earl and his mother when I was there

349
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:11,493
and they're some of the loveliest people

350
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:14,181
I've ever met in my whole life

351
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:18,825
and this painting introduces
you to so many new friends

352
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:21,874
and Earl and his mother
are just two of many people

353
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:24,143
that I've had the opportunity to meet.

354
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:25,935
Just through painting.

355
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:28,092
There.

356
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:30,399
(brushing)

357
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,167
Okay,

358
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,471
but isn't that little rascal good?

359
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:34,847
I mean he can paint.

360
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,659
(beating brush)

361
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:38,884
All I'm doing is just making
some reflections in here

362
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,182
while you're doing that.

363
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,089
Look at that finished painting

364
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,423
and if I remember I think
Earl was nine years old now

365
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:48,063
going on 40.

366
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,393
(laughs)

367
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,460
Isn't he something?

368
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,550
I am so proud of that young man.

369
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:55,493
All I've done is just tap
in a little dark color here.

370
00:13:55,494 --> 00:14:00,011
Trying to remember basically
where we had things.

371
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:03,759
Maybe that came down about like that.

372
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,021
Somewhere in there,

373
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:07,472
but notice as we're doing this,

374
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,733
we're putting the
reflections with each layer

375
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,867
because if I didn't pull this down,

376
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:15,151
before I did this part it
would mess up that of course.

377
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:19,640
So each layer, pull your
reflections down just like so.

378
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:22,868
Before you do the next layer

379
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:26,023
and that way it'll work so much easier.

380
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:26,921
There,

381
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,763
now we can come back.

382
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:31,343
Put in all kinds of little things in here.

383
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,009
(brush tapping)

384
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,293
Something like that.

385
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,835
Think that came right on out right there.

386
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,437
Okay.

387
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:43,206
Now then.

388
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:43,974
We can just,

389
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:44,998
we'll just use that same old brush.

390
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:46,064
We can go right into

391
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:47,208
a little of the cad yellow,

392
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,229
yellow ochre,

393
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,923
Indian yellow

394
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:52,634
and then I'll hit a little
touch of the bright red,

395
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:54,170
but mix the color on the brush

396
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,091
so you have a multitude of
colors happening right there

397
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,499
on your brush.

398
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,206
Okay let's go back up here.

399
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:00,315
Now,

400
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:02,704
we'll put some nice green highlights

401
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,391
right out here on this little peninsula

402
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:09,269
that juts out into the water.

403
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,341
Just tap.

404
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:12,004
Tap, tap.

405
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:13,243
Now then, watch.

406
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:14,907
Let's play some games.

407
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:15,931
Sometimes it's fun,

408
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:16,869
let me find,

409
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:19,344
we'll use a number three fan brush today.

410
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:21,264
Let me pile my color up.

411
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:22,961
If your color gets too flat on the palate

412
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,932
you have to sort of pile it up

413
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,212
so you can load a brush.

414
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,791
So if you ever have trouble

415
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,711
loading the brush yet you
know there's enough paint,

416
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,996
just put it in a pile and
then you can load your brush.

417
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:36,495
Otherwise you just polish your palate.

418
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:37,648
There.

419
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,312
Okay let's,

420
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:43,450
go right in here and make it
look like there's some trees

421
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,967
that just go right out like that

422
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,125
but you have to put that grassy area

423
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,702
back in here first

424
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:52,238
then put your trees and then come back

425
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:53,989
and put your next layer.

426
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,932
So that it looks like there's layers

427
00:15:56,932 --> 00:15:58,375
and that's what'll make your painting

428
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,644
stand out and be special.

429
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,996
Alright, now then,

430
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,574
back to our big brush,

431
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:08,922
with all the little grassy things on it.

432
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:11,738
We can come right back in here.

433
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,359
See there?

434
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,663
And begin laying in

435
00:16:15,663 --> 00:16:19,753
all kinds of little areas.

436
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:22,574
There.

437
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,946
You can make this just
as soft as a meadow.

438
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:26,628
Okay.

439
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:27,609
Now then let's have some fun.

440
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:30,888
Gotta mix up some more color.

441
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:32,772
Let's use some Prussian blue,

442
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:34,863
some black,

443
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:37,770
alizarin crimson, sap green.

444
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,289
Sounds good.

445
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:42,123
Might as well mix up a
pretty good pile of paint.

446
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:45,716
We're gonna use it before
this one's finished.

447
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:47,892
Get a big fan brush, it's time we get,

448
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:50,366
got strong here.

449
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:52,968
There.

450
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,036
Okay.

451
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,040
Just fill the brush up full of color.

452
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,132
Lot of color.

453
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:01,834
Now then we have to make
some big decisions here.

454
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:04,276
I think right there.

455
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:06,110
Right here.

456
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,594
We will have a nice evergreen tree

457
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:14,013
and I'm intentionally letting
this go right over the tape.

458
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:16,786
So when we pull the tape off,

459
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,730
you'll only see part of the tree.

460
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,566
Maybe we'll give him a friend.

461
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:22,453
You know me,

462
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:25,831
think everybody needs a friend.

463
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:27,752
There,

464
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:30,183
and as I say that's one
thing that painting has done.

465
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,203
As Annette and I have
traveled around the country

466
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:34,212
teaching people,

467
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,526
we have made so many fantastic friends

468
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:39,768
that have been with us for so long now

469
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,200
and that might truly
be the joy of painting

470
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,229
is the friends that you make doing it.

471
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:46,722
I'm gonna take,

472
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:48,812
I'm gonna tell you what.

473
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,733
I was about to leave this trunk out.

474
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:53,164
Poor little thing would
fall over from weakness.

475
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:55,511
Take a little dark sienna and white,

476
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,432
little roll of paint,

477
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:59,692
and our little evergreen tree here.

478
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,442
Let's just put

479
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:03,831
least little indication

480
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,136
of a tree trunk.

481
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,396
There.

482
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:09,932
Now then,

483
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:11,384
I have dark green,

484
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:12,365
the little brush,

485
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:13,346
doesn't matter which brush you use

486
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,565
I just happened to pick it up.

487
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:19,746
Put a few little highlights
on this rascal here.

488
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:22,549
There.

489
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,709
Alright.

490
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,602
Now then let's take some van dyke brown

491
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:28,848
on the old knife

492
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:30,425
and let's go right in here,

493
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,369
put some banks underneath this grass.

494
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:36,356
Just some little banks,

495
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:37,115
wherever.

496
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:41,683
Maybe there's a lot of
dirt showing right there.

497
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:42,201
There

498
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:42,919
and wherever.

499
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,421
We can go ahead and put
some down in here too,

500
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:47,577
'cause we know it's going
to end up being there

501
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:49,668
and here and there maybe
there's gonna be some dirt

502
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,038
up in here wherever.

503
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:54,959
Doesn't much matter.

504
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,477
Little touch of brown and white

505
00:18:57,477 --> 00:19:01,230
and we can just tip that a little.

506
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,772
Just to make it look like rocks and dirt.

507
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:05,924
There.

508
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:09,537
All kinds of little things are happening.

509
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:13,614
There they are.

510
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:17,045
There, okay.

511
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,857
Now I'm gonna take my fan
brush that has the green on it

512
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:24,442
and go back in here and pop in
a little bush here and there.

513
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:25,934
Just enough to sort of break up that edge

514
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:28,665
and bring all that together.

515
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,371
Maybe there's some nice
bushes right here in front of

516
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:33,657
those little trees.

517
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:35,619
Take the knife,

518
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:39,625
scrape in few little sticks and twigs

519
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,704
and sometimes I scratch down,

520
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:44,984
sometime I scratch up.

521
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:49,104
Just depends on what kind
of mood I'm in. (laughs)

522
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:52,668
That you'll find by
touching it and pulling up

523
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:56,038
you'll get a sharper point on the end.

524
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,000
There if that makes sense.

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,638
Let's go we'll use a one inch brush.

526
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:02,730
Maybe we have a

527
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,656
big bush if I remember correctly,

528
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:06,364
it lives right about

529
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:07,088
here.

530
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,630
So we just throw some dark
in so our light will show.

531
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:12,670
Push upward with a one inch brush.

532
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,172
Create all those little,

533
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,211
little leafy feelings.

534
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:19,265
I'm gonna take another one inch brush,

535
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,271
dip it in liquid white.

536
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,522
I'm gonna go through the cad yellow,

537
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,512
be right back here,

538
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,366
a little sap green.

539
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:28,123
Pull the brush in one direction.

540
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:29,231
Loading it fully.

541
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:30,086
Lot of paint.

542
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:32,496
Look at all the paint.

543
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:33,903
Lot of paint on that brush.

544
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:35,559
Let's go up here.

545
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,463
Now,

546
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:37,871
gently push upward.

547
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,006
Just gently,

548
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,158
gently,

549
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,522
and turn the brush

550
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:44,528
to form all these individual little limbs

551
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:45,979
and branches.

552
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,836
Don't just push them all in one direction.

553
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:52,271
It'll look like you're lazy.

554
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,503
There.

555
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,594
Okay we can change the
flavor just a little bit

556
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:59,797
with some yellow ochre,
little Indian yellow.

557
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:04,064
Put another little thing right in there.

558
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:09,312
Just wherever, wherever.

559
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,277
Go back to the old two
inch brush that had all the

560
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:14,485
greens on it

561
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:17,934
and maybe

562
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:20,917
tap in just an indication,

563
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:24,724
some little grassy areas back in there.

564
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:28,394
Come right down here.

565
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:31,210
Somewhere in like in there.

566
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,045
Now,

567
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:36,800
let this one come right on out.

568
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,207
Wherever you want

569
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,488
and once again,

570
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:42,295
this is not an exact
duplicate of what you see

571
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:44,906
at the beginning of the show,

572
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:49,166
but it will show you
exactly the way it was made

573
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:51,178
and it may turn out better
than the one that you see

574
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:52,671
at the beginning of the show.

575
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:55,053
Who knows.

576
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:57,322
Okay we can take a little paint thinner,

577
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:59,326
a little brown.

578
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:03,279
Make it thin like ink

579
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,548
and we had,

580
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:05,402
let's see here.

581
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:07,152
We right here,

582
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:10,650
we'll have a nice little tree

583
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,357
that lives right up there.

584
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:13,849
There he goes.

585
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,836
In fact there was two of them.

586
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:21,451
Other one goes right
on over there somewhere

587
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:24,750
and then we can put all
kinds of little limbs

588
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,608
and sticks and twigs and
whatever you want on here.

589
00:22:29,871 --> 00:22:33,576
There we go.

590
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:35,537
That's nice when you have a lot of time

591
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,627
and you can just sit and put all kinds of

592
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:40,196
little branches and sticks on here.

593
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:43,865
That's so pretty.

594
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:46,339
There.

595
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:49,155
Little bit more of the thinner.

596
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:51,673
Make that one a little fatter,

597
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:54,062
'cause he's the big guy.

598
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:55,642
Give this one a little more body

599
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:58,244
and we're in business.

600
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,651
There we go.

601
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:00,882
Now then,

602
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,211
let's have some fun.

603
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:03,698
Think it's time to take the tape off

604
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:06,522
and see what we have here.

605
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:07,800
Alright,

606
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,867
grab the old tape.

607
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:11,640
(tape peeling)

608
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:15,902
And just pull it right off there.

609
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,871
Okay and now we'll come back,

610
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:19,278
let's get this second one.

611
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,914
(tape peeling)

612
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,782
Pull it right off,

613
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:25,976
and isn't that neat?

614
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:30,579
Already we have all that stuff there done.

615
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:33,956
Okay.

616
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,533
There we go.

617
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:38,605
Tape gets stuck on everything.

618
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:42,061
Now then, now we can have some fun.

619
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:45,560
Now I like taking the liner brush.

620
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,205
Once again make that paint very thin

621
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:49,485
and let's go back over

622
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:53,326
and I wanna pull one of these
trees through this line.

623
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:55,202
It just,

624
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:57,080
just sort of makes it interesting.

625
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,005
Everybody will be interested in this.

626
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,492
When you do it this way.

627
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:05,614
It's so different.

628
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:07,405
There,

629
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,898
and then, now this one,

630
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:10,562
I don't wanna come through this one,

631
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:12,739
but over here I'm gonna bring it through

632
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:15,298
if that makes any sense at all.

633
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:19,115
So it looks like it looks like this one

634
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:22,801
is behind that line.

635
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:24,681
There.

636
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:26,438
Alright.

637
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:29,552
Now then.

638
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,794
You know me and my big trees here.

639
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:34,502
Let's take,

640
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:37,104
let's take the old fan brush.

641
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:40,432
Fill it up full of that dark, dark color

642
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:42,003
and go right up here.

643
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:44,136
I think there was a large tree that lived,

644
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,673
boy he does now.

645
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:47,599
Right there,

646
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,349
and just start,

647
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:50,714
corner of the brush,

648
00:24:50,714 --> 00:24:52,378
working back and forth,

649
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:54,468
back and forth.

650
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:55,578
There.

651
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,626
Now the one that we show at the opening

652
00:24:57,626 --> 00:25:00,603
has a naked spot right there. (laughs)

653
00:25:00,603 --> 00:25:03,728
He didn't grow ant fir right there.

654
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:06,544
That's why they call them fir trees.

655
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:09,061
Okay.

656
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,852
Right on down,

657
00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:12,474
letting go

658
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:14,172
and all we're doing is
putting in some background

659
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:16,281
color right now.

660
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,628
Now then he had a friend,

661
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:21,779
lived right there.

662
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:25,961
There we go.

663
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:27,332
See,

664
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:30,447
and I'm gonna let him project right out

665
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,347
clean over where the tape was.

666
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:35,261
So that'll push everything back.

667
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:39,517
This whole painting is a game of planes.

668
00:25:39,517 --> 00:25:41,167
It's a lot of fun.

669
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:41,848
Lot of fun,

670
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:43,384
you'll enjoy it.

671
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:47,987
Tap in little bit of dark stuff here.

672
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,917
We can go back,

673
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,539
put the least little touch of highlight

674
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:56,142
on this big old tree.

675
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:57,380
Little green and yellow,

676
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,025
that's all we're using.

677
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,217
Something like that.

678
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:04,548
Take our one inch brush,

679
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:05,913
dip it in the liquid white,

680
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:08,301
go through our yellows,

681
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,923
greens,

682
00:26:09,923 --> 00:26:13,806
and let's just make a happy
little bush or two down here

683
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,427
and we got it.

684
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:17,168
There.

685
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,353
See, little touch of the
yellow ochre here and there

686
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:22,887
just to break it up.

687
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:25,538
There we are.

688
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:28,392
But isn't that a
fantastic little painting?

689
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:30,062
Guarantee if you do this one,

690
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:32,237
it will certainly get people's attention.

691
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:34,371
They will love it

692
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:37,230
and I think with that we're
going to call this one finished.

693
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,467
From all of us here,

694
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,216
I'd like to wish you happy painting

695
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,519
and God bless my friend.

696
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:47,403
(upbeat music)
