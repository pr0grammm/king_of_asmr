1
00:00:00,028 --> 00:00:02,415
- Hello again. Glad to see you.

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:04,939
Thought today we'd one of
these almighty black canvases.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:08,031
It's time we got into doing
something on a black canvas.

4
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:09,338
I'd like to show you how

5
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:11,199
you can do a beautiful,
beautiful landscape

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,764
on a black canvas.

7
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:14,182
I've already went ahead,

8
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:17,480
because we are short of time on this show,

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,688
I've already went ahead and
covered the whole canvas

10
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,949
with Alizarin crimson.

11
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:24,759
Now I'm gonna take a little Van Dyke brown

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,091
and work into the edges,
just around the edges,

13
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,902
so it's, we already have it
covered with Alizarin crimson,

14
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:33,578
and now we're putting
a little brown on it.

15
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:37,212
The whole canvas was covered with crimson.

16
00:00:37,212 --> 00:00:38,060
There we go.

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,060
Just around the corners.

18
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:45,059
Thought today we'd do a
beautiful little sunset.

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,597
And maybe we'll have a little sunset

20
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:50,966
like the sun's going down
behind the hill back there.

21
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,274
And we just have a
beautiful glow in the sky,

22
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:56,985
and then we'll go from there.

23
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:59,198
Now I'm gonna take and
pull this back and forth

24
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:01,016
to a get a nice even
distribution of paint,

25
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:04,507
working it up and down, back and forth.

26
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:05,507
There we go.

27
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:10,917
All right.

28
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:17,481
Mm 'kay, now we'll start
with a one-inch brush,

29
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,984
we'll use a little bit of cad yellow.

30
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:22,549
Figure out where the
sun is, just went down,

31
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,439
and we're gonna start like right here.

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,356
And begin working this paint around.

33
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,227
You start in the center and work

34
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:32,762
around and around and around,

35
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:34,751
and already it's picking
up the Alizarin crimson

36
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:35,751
and it's turning into

37
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:39,918
a beautiful little yellow-ish
orange-ish glow here.

38
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:42,153
There we go.

39
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,355
And we'll start right
here, let it work outward.

40
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,814
You want it to get darker and
darker and darker and darker

41
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,622
as it goes out toward the edges.

42
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:59,790
So we always start with a
color in here and work outward.

43
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,099
There we go.

44
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,382
Okay.

45
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:14,423
A little bit of color here, work it out,

46
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:16,774
and I'm doing this in
little-bitty X patterns.

47
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:20,441
Back and forth, back
and forth, there we go.

48
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,175
Mm 'kay.

49
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:27,437
Now let's take the big brush,

50
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:29,987
and gently gently hypnotize this.

51
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:32,819
We're still making the little X's.

52
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:40,282
There.

53
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:43,151
Just work that in.

54
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:52,705
And then just enough to
take out the brushstrokes.

55
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,352
Okay.

56
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:59,103
(water sloshing)

57
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:04,264
(paintbrush rattling)

58
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:07,426
Okay, let's take a little bit
of Alizarin, a little brown,

59
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:11,210
put it together here on the
brush, mix on the brush.

60
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:12,419
And maybe back here in the distance

61
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:14,757
we'll have a little foothill back here.

62
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:18,257
Just let this brush bounce along and play.

63
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:20,472
There we go.

64
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:24,942
Don't let the size of
this big brush scare you.

65
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:27,025
It does fantastic things.

66
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:32,467
Okay.

67
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,082
Now, maybe we'll have some highlights.

68
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:43,384
Take the little yellow and green and,

69
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,748
little touch of red here,

70
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:48,122
and we just push some little
highlights coming down here.

71
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:52,289
We'll make these little foothills
way back in the distance.

72
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:59,006
Okay.

73
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,506
Let's put some back over here.

74
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:04,504
There we go.

75
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,514
Then we'll take a clean brush,
and just gently lift up,

76
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:18,728
very very lightly,

77
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,755
just enough to give it an upward swirl.

78
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:22,588
There.

79
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,259
Very light, barely barely
touching the canvas.

80
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,858
You let two or three
hairs just about touch.

81
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,442
Just enough to move
the paint a little bit.

82
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:40,731
Okay.

83
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:43,201
Now we'll take a little yellow

84
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,300
and a little permanent
red mixed together here,

85
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,413
and we'll start putting
in some reflections.

86
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,533
Maybe we'll have a little,

87
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:55,487
have a little lake right
back here, a little pond.

88
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,414
Just lay a little color on.

89
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,997
And pull this down.

90
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:03,985
There we go.

91
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:12,757
Then just enough to give
a little watery effect.

92
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:14,104
Just

93
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,342
ripple it a little.

94
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:17,425
We don't want to destroy.

95
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,677
(water sloshing)

96
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:26,012
Mm 'kay.

97
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:27,951
(brush rattling)

98
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:32,117
Clean the old brushes here,
and we'll move right along.

99
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,726
Okay now I'm gonna go back
into this brown and Alizarin.

100
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:41,262
Once again we're mixing it on the brush.

101
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,698
A lot of paint on the brush.

102
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,985
Maybe we'll put a little
tree standing back here.

103
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:51,235
We'll make this one with the fan brush.

104
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:57,242
There we go.

105
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,485
And trees get lonely too,
so we'll give him a friend.

106
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:07,749
There.

107
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,173
And maybe there's a
little one right there.

108
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,497
Got two big ones, so,
invariably sooner or later

109
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,218
there's gonna be a little one.

110
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,218
There he is.

111
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:34,333
Let's fill him in, make
him just a touch darker.

112
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:40,816
Maybe we'll put a third one right there.

113
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:52,092
Work that in a little bit,
create a shadow behind the tree.

114
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,834
Okay.

115
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:57,584
(water sloshing)

116
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,693
Now, we'll just, with a knife here

117
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,741
we'll just make a little waterline

118
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,908
running back through here.

119
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:16,543
These black canvases, we
cover with a black acrylic.

120
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:18,489
A flat black acrylic paint,

121
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:21,488
and allow it to dry before we start.

122
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:25,495
And the Alizarin crimson that we use here,

123
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:28,041
is a transparent color, so
the black shows through.

124
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,213
It looks black, but when
you apply color to it,

125
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:33,815
man it really comes alive.

126
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:37,959
Okay, let's start with some
almighty trees and stuff.

127
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,382
We'll use the big brush today.

128
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:43,799
And let's have a big old tree right here.

129
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,139
I know this may be quite
difficult for you to see

130
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,305
but we are putting the general
shape of the tree right here.

131
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,845
These black canvases make
some of the prettiest pictures

132
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:07,116
that you could imagine.

133
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:08,681
And if you're interested
in selling paintings

134
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:11,579
and making a happy buck
to put in your pocket,

135
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:14,045
these are the ones that really sell.

136
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:17,472
Let's have another tree right over here.

137
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:20,638
Let these limbs just fly out, firemen.

138
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,954
Maybe a big tree up here.

139
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:35,160
And as you can see, we're
really hitting this canvas,

140
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,338
we're really pushing the paint into it.

141
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,589
You need an almighty easel.

142
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:44,378
Little Tiny Tim easels will let you down.

143
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:49,576
This easel is made out of
a platform step-ladder.

144
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,356
And they work very very well.

145
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:55,451
They're very strong, very simple to build.

146
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,283
Okay.

147
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:59,004
We've got that filled in.

148
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:02,375
Let's put some tree trunks here and there.

149
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,993
Okay.

150
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:07,910
And we'll put some dark
paint right along here.

151
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:10,798
There we go.

152
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:15,715
Just, in your mind,

153
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:17,533
wherever you visualize there
might be a little trunk,

154
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,951
just drop one in.

155
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,288
Now mix just a little brown and white,

156
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:26,385
so we can put a little
touch of highlight on this

157
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:28,968
and make it stand out a little,

158
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:36,399
like a light's playing
through here and touching it.

159
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,231
There.

160
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:45,177
And we'll put a trunk right
over in this one, too.

161
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:46,345
Little dabble.

162
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:53,861
Okay.

163
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,033
Now, if the sun's here, light's
coming from this direction,

164
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,700
this would be highlighted
on the other side.

165
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:10,760
Now probably in reality,
if the sky was this dark,

166
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,822
you would have nothing but silhouettes.

167
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,099
But that would be a boring picture.

168
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:17,016
This is a lot more fun.

169
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,034
Okay, you take a little
bit of magic white,

170
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,698
little yellow,

171
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:30,281
maybe a touch of Phthalo green.

172
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,964
And we can put some nice little leaves

173
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:40,266
on all these little bushes.

174
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,807
Look how that color stands out

175
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,698
against this black background.

176
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:45,781
It just jumps out at you.

177
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:52,449
Okay, now, let's,

178
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:57,023
let's put some on this little bush.

179
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:06,012
And there's some little
things growing down in here.

180
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:10,423
Use your imagination, let it go.

181
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:11,255
Let it go.

182
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,611
Remember, this is your world.

183
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:19,778
In your world you can create
anything that you desire.

184
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:25,820
Okay, let's do this old big tree here.

185
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,442
What's so very nice about
these black canvases,

186
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,073
if there's a light
shining directly on them

187
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,629
they look totally different
than if they're without a light.

188
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:43,996
So in essence it's almost like

189
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,459
having two paintings in one.

190
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,345
Especially if you hang these,
after they're finished,

191
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,630
over a light, so at night
if you turn the light on

192
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,774
it shines up on this,

193
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,192
it's remarkable what happens.

194
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:02,687
There we go.

195
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,580
All the little bushy areas.

196
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:15,601
Maybe some little touches out here.

197
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,236
Okay.

198
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:28,932
Now let's take some more Van Dyke brown

199
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:33,621
and let's put an almighty tree right here.

200
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,540
We'll just let him bend and play and

201
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,624
work right on up to here.

202
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,119
And, there we go.

203
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,267
There.

204
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:05,149
Have another little limb
coming down through here.

205
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,464
And maybe there's some little things

206
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:09,131
happening up here in the leaves.

207
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,958
And we'll have a little
light playing across here.

208
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,646
Just pull that knife sort of, swirled,

209
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:23,397
so it gives the appearance
of it being round.

210
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:30,943
There we go.

211
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,312
Now we're ready to put some highlights

212
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:37,979
on these little leaves out here.

213
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:40,741
Okay.

214
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:45,875
And just let the light
play through this tree.

215
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:55,822
Leaving a lot of dark areas.

216
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:59,552
We need these dark areas to
make the tree look round.

217
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,134
Don't kill 'em all.

218
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:06,682
Such a, such a temptation,
to do a little bit more.

219
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:10,612
I used to work with one art teacher,

220
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:13,313
that, he had a set of handcuffs
that hung in the studio,

221
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,672
and he'd walk by and he'd bump you

222
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:16,384
and he'd point at those handcuffs.

223
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:17,217
And that was his way of saying,

224
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:19,533
"You're beginning to fiddle it to death."

225
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,932
We don't have any handcuffs here today,

226
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:23,837
but stand back and look
every once in a while.

227
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:28,004
Don't overwork your picture,
you'll fiddle it to death.

228
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,544
Okay.

229
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:32,230
This looks like a

230
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,384
super place, maybe, to have a little path

231
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:37,399
that runs up through there.

232
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,229
So now take a little Prussian
blue and Van Dyke brown

233
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:45,974
and just very easy here,
we'll just make a little path

234
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:47,834
that runs right through this.

235
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,274
Got to have a way to get around the lake

236
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:52,693
to catch that big trout
that lives out there.

237
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,026
Know he's there.

238
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,072
Okay.

239
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,180
Then we'll put just a little
bit of highlight on there.

240
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:09,125
Just let that run down
through there and break.

241
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,485
You want that paint to break.

242
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:16,284
So it leaves some of those
beautiful dark areas in there.

243
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:17,284
There we go.

244
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:20,247
Now.

245
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:23,879
Little bit more magic white here.

246
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,298
Just want to thin that paint

247
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:28,076
so it'll stick on top
of all the other paint.

248
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,939
Now we can start in here.

249
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:32,750
We'll start putting some

250
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,918
nice little bushes that
are hanging over the path.

251
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:45,014
So the path just disappears
back here behind the big tree.

252
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,192
Okay.

253
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:00,630
And these bushes
protruding up over the top,

254
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,182
push it down into the picture.

255
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:03,784
You need 'em.

256
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,971
They pay you great dividends.

257
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:08,246
And we'll put some on this side

258
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:10,163
of the road over there.

259
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:13,687
Mm 'kay.

260
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:17,814
Let's make another big tree.

261
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:19,533
Maybe right up through here.

262
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:22,662
We'll just have a big ol' tree.

263
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:25,162
There he goes. Van Dyke brown.

264
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,562
Van Dyke brown's a very nice color,

265
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:35,395
it's almost like a
chocolate brown, very warm.

266
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:37,879
There.

267
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:49,846
Okay, now a little limb right there.

268
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,047
Now one thing I'd like
to mention while we're

269
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:05,467
putting the highlights on here,

270
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,505
if you have questions or comments or

271
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:11,719
anything you'd lie to know
about what we're doing here,

272
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,950
please feel free to drop us a line,

273
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,980
care WMVT, and we'll give you the address

274
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,896
at the end of the show.

275
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:21,134
And do use it, so you know,

276
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,103
we're here to help you,

277
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,042
if you have problems or
if you have questions,

278
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,683
anything concerning
this method of painting,

279
00:17:26,683 --> 00:17:30,339
we'll be glad to work with
you and try to help you.

280
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,173
Okay.

281
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:36,596
We'll put some highlights
up here on this one.

282
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,968
Little bit more of the
magic, thin it down.

283
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:41,051
Just a touch.

284
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:45,234
Okay.

285
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:59,379
Thousands and thousands and
thousands of little leaves.

286
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:07,833
Okay, now, let's go down here,

287
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,083
put some little things around the tree.

288
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,614
And maybe you can, right here, say,

289
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:21,499
let's put a little stone.

290
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:25,582
Maybe a little stone just
lays right along here.

291
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:28,344
Of course he's a happy little stone.

292
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:30,760
We don't have any other kind.

293
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:42,263
And we'll make up a
little highlight color.

294
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:44,430
Just lay right over there.

295
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:47,596
Like so.

296
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:54,721
Okay,

297
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,500
now let's put some, mm, nice one there.

298
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:02,298
Nice one there.

299
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:07,658
Okay, let's have some little
bushes right along in here.

300
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:09,699
Now when you're doing this,

301
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:12,449
load this brush by pulling
it in one direction

302
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,461
so that it looks like
an old shoe on the end,

303
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:16,045
sort of hangs over.

304
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,550
You put that round part to the top,

305
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,173
and tilt the brush sort of downward

306
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,507
and just push,

307
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:25,967
just enough to bend the
bristles a little bit.

308
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,996
Don't fight it, let the brush do the work.

309
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:31,079
You have the fun, let the brush work.

310
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:36,785
Maybe we'll put a nice
little sparkler right there.

311
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:39,206
Just sort of to break that up a little it.

312
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:40,038
Okay.

313
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:46,060
Now let's lay in a few
stems here and there.

314
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:50,519
And all we're doing here
is literally just cutting

315
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,855
right through the paint,
using the point of the knife.

316
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:56,522
We literally just cut the paint.

317
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,115
There we go.

318
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,214
This is one of the paintings

319
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:09,144
that we do in class quite frequently.

320
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:10,827
It's a very effective painting,

321
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:14,093
it teaches you how to use black canvases.

322
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:15,593
It's a lot of fun.

323
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:19,790
And it's extremely, extremely effective.

324
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:26,453
We'll have a few little
sticks coming over like so.

325
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,453
There we go.

326
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:39,903
And once again, these little
twigs and these little sticks

327
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:42,066
show different planes in the picture.

328
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,576
It produces the illusion of distance.

329
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,742
Use 'em to your advantage.

330
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,704
'Cause the woods are always full of them.

331
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:54,983
Let's see, maybe back here we could just

332
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:57,939
put a little indication
of a trunk here and there,

333
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,523
some little sticks.

334
00:21:01,078 --> 00:21:02,078
There we go.

335
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:10,849
Okay.

336
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:19,377
All righty, I think this
one's just about ready.

337
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,402
Then we can sign it.

338
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:24,706
So I'll use a very thin oil here.

339
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:26,288
And we'll just take

340
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,882
and use the liner brush,

341
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:31,758
and you mix this paint
until it's like water.

342
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,076
And if you mix it very very thin,

343
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:36,070
curl that brush as you pull it out,

344
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,293
twist it, so it brings it to a point.

345
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:40,961
It's just like you were writing.

346
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:45,866
You don't have to wait
until the painting is dry.

347
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:46,700
Okay.

348
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,263
There.

349
00:21:56,335 --> 00:21:57,727
(water sloshing)

350
00:21:57,727 --> 00:22:00,017
This same technique is also very good

351
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:03,912
if you want to put some nice
little sticks and limbs in

352
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:05,556
that you wanted to draw in,

353
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:08,044
use the oil to get the paint thin.

354
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:11,780
And then maybe we could
come right across and,

355
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:14,495
'cause a thin paint will
stick to a thick paint.

356
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:15,970
There.

357
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,136
Just let these little things
happen here and there.

358
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:23,160
Okay.

359
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:26,974
One of the things that we're trying to do

360
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:29,963
as we travel around and
teach this almighty method,

361
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:33,558
is we're trying to gather
up an army of teachers.

362
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:34,952
And soon we'll have teachers that

363
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:38,037
travel this entire beautiful country,

364
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:41,969
teaching this fantastic
method of painting.

365
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:45,552
If you would like to
have some information,

366
00:22:46,402 --> 00:22:47,808
drop us a line.

367
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,642
Once again,

368
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:51,636
we'll show you the address
at the end of the show.

369
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,693
And soon we'll have
information on teachers

370
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:56,269
that are all the way across this country.

371
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:57,628
Teachers that we can guarantee

372
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:00,711
that can teach this fantastic method.

373
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:03,137
Okay.

374
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:06,020
I think now, we'll just
put a couple little things

375
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,270
here and there.

376
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:13,577
Put another little stick or two.

377
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:24,523
I hope you've painted along with us

378
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,975
and you've enjoyed this
half as much as we have.

379
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,568
We really enjoy doing
these black canvases,

380
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:32,581
they are extremely, extremely effective,

381
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:34,518
and you'll find

382
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:37,191
that they bring a nice
warm glow to your heart.

383
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:39,305
These can be done in
a multitude of colors.

384
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:43,167
You can cover 'em with any
color that's transparent.

385
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:46,288
We can use the Prussian blue, sap green,

386
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:49,280
any of these colors, or
combinations of colors.

387
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,298
Later on in this series

388
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:53,250
we'll do a winter
picture on a black canvas

389
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,835
and I'll show you how you
can put the moon in the sky

390
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,611
and let the light play across the snow

391
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:00,616
when you have the almighty
mountains and stuff.

392
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:02,106
And I'll think you'll find

393
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:04,425
these black canvases
can do fantastic things.

394
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:06,880
We also wanna do some
pictures in the series

395
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:09,754
where we paint the canvas with one color.

396
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:11,584
Instead of putting the
magic white on the canvas,

397
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:15,122
we'll paint it, for
example, the sap green.

398
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:16,715
And we'll paint beautiful pictures

399
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:18,698
by doing that.

400
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:20,956
There's a multitude of things
that can be done with this.

401
00:24:20,955 --> 00:24:24,064
Use it, experiment with it, go with it.

402
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:26,467
Just let your heart be your guide.

403
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:29,545
Let your imagination take you
anywhere that you want to go.

404
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,168
Let it go.

405
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,718
Okay.

406
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:36,230
All righty, I think we're gonna
call that picture finished.

407
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,913
And, once again,

408
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:41,600
we want to thank you very
much for watching us.

409
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:44,862
And from all of us here
at WMVT, happy painting.

410
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:46,528
Thank you very much.

411
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:50,750
