1
00:00:00,888 --> 00:00:02,722
- Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:04,580
Certainly glad you could join us today,

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,961
it's a fantastic day here

4
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:07,761
and I hope it is wherever you're at.

5
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:09,432
Tell you what, let's start out today

6
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:11,603
and have 'em run all the
colors across the screen

7
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:13,600
that you need to paint this
little painting along with us.

8
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:15,168
While they're doing that, let me show you

9
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,375
what I've got done today.

10
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,941
Have my standard old 18 x 24 inch canvas,

11
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,178
but you can use any size
that's convenient for you.

12
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:24,452
Now, today I've taken and covered
the top part of the canvas

13
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:25,916
with liquid white.

14
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,981
Now, liquid white's just
and oil-based medium

15
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:29,689
that makes the canvas wet and slick

16
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,778
and allows us to actually blend color

17
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:33,253
right on the canvas.

18
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:35,528
The bottom now, I started
with liquid black,

19
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:37,398
which is the same identical medium,

20
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:39,023
only it's black.

21
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:41,392
And I started making
little x's and I worked up

22
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:42,936
'til they blended together,

23
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:45,570
so we have a graduation
from white to black.

24
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,006
And with that, let's just make
a happy little scene today,

25
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,735
one that's fun and I think you'll enjoy.

26
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:54,140
Let's start out with a
little tiny two inch brush.

27
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:56,364
There we go.

28
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:57,966
Take a little bit of the thalo blue.

29
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:00,789
Now, thalo blue is a
gorgeous, gorgeous blue.

30
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,051
Beautiful color, don't need
much though, it's very strong.

31
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:07,894
Tap the bristles, that
distributes the paint

32
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:09,821
all the way through the
bristles very evenly.

33
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,430
Okay, let's go up in here.

34
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,822
Now, I'm gonna start
up here in this corner,

35
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:16,423
just making little x's,
little criss cross strokes.

36
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:20,473
And we just dance in a
quick little happy sky.

37
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:22,573
There, very easy little sky,

38
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:24,072
something nice and simple,

39
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:26,103
we'll just drop it in like that.

40
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:29,405
There, that's all there is to it,

41
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:30,439
little something like that.

42
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:33,000
Now then, go back in the same color,

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,016
only this time I'm gonna tap the bristles

44
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:36,885
firmly right into the paint,

45
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,149
but very little paint, just tap it.

46
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,217
See? Just tap.

47
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:43,329
Now we take that top corner of the brush

48
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,790
and I wanna make the
indication of a big old,

49
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,893
strong cloud.

50
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:49,460
We're using exactly the same color.

51
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:52,303
But just by doing something this simple,

52
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:55,793
you can create that illusion
without a lot of work.

53
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,091
There we go.

54
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,228
And I'm lazy, I look for easy ways

55
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:03,525
to make gorgeous paintings that work.

56
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:06,477
That's what makes this whole
technique so fantastic.

57
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:07,737
It works.

58
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:09,526
There we go.

59
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,406
Something like that.

60
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,704
There.

61
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:18,992
This style of painting is not
for just a few special people,

62
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:21,532
anybody can do this, anybody.

63
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,970
I have people in their 90s
that write me letters and say,

64
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,765
"My fourth grade art teacher
told me I have no talent

65
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:29,133
"and I've spent my whole
life wanting to paint

66
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:32,546
"and I tried your technique and it works,

67
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:34,526
"it works."

68
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,128
Now, those are the kind of
letters that I love to see.

69
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:39,137
There.

70
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:42,201
Alright we just blend it a little bit.

71
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:45,954
Now then, tell you what,

72
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:47,162
I'm gonna grab another brush,

73
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:49,027
I have several of 'em going here.

74
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:51,314
I'm gonna dip it into,
just tap it the same way

75
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:52,627
into a little bit of the titanium white,

76
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:53,891
just a small amount.

77
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,331
I wanna put a little
indication here and there,

78
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,397
maybe of a little sunlight that just

79
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:59,406
zinging through these clouds,

80
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,368
so I just tap in a little area,

81
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:03,668
get our little blender brush,

82
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:05,711
and very lightly you can blend that

83
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,940
and it might not look
like a whole lot now,

84
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,913
but when your painting's finished

85
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,979
it'll look like little light
areas where the sunlight's

86
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,762
playing through there.

87
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,250
There, it's also a nice
way of making clouds.

88
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,182
Today I just wanna put
little indications of

89
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:22,170
little happy floaters that
are going all over the sky.

90
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,773
Back to our little blender.

91
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,166
And this blender brush is so soft,

92
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,913
you can blend right over that firm paint

93
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:30,887
without disturbing it.

94
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:32,384
Alright.

95
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,147
That's all there is to it.

96
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,668
With that we got a pretty nice little sky.

97
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:41,414
Let's take black, midnght black,

98
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:44,314
alizerin crimson, a little thalo blue,

99
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:47,379
we'll put a little Van
Dyke brown there too,

100
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,680
what the heck?

101
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,533
It's your world, you make it
any old color you want it.

102
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,592
What we're looking predominantly for,

103
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:54,411
black color, dark.

104
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:57,260
Cut off a little roll of paint
and it lives right there,

105
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:59,091
you can see it, lives right
on the edge of the knife.

106
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:00,262
Let's go up in here.

107
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:03,068
Now let's have a big
mountain that lives up here

108
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,082
in our world, right there.

109
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:09,789
Just take the knife and
firmly push this paint

110
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,402
right into the fabric
of the canvas, push it.

111
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:17,449
Push it, really get in there and

112
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:19,819
this is where you take
out all your frustrations

113
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,990
and hostilities.

114
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,504
Get in there and

115
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,370
just, as my son Steve says, mush it in.

116
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,379
There we go.

117
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,391
I don't know if that's a word or not,

118
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,975
but everybody knows what
he means when he says that.

119
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:36,403
Now we'll take a two inch brush

120
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:37,935
and we wanna grab this,

121
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:40,834
this has the liquid white and black on it.

122
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:44,770
So color will move, you can
literally slide it around

123
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:45,961
on the canvas.

124
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,508
If this was a dry canvas,
right now you'd be

125
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,035
in agony city trying to pull that paint.

126
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:54,221
But it's wet and we can
move it anywhere we want it.

127
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,384
The only thing we're concerned with

128
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,288
is that nice top edge up here,

129
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:00,943
rest of it, we don't care.

130
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:03,579
We really don't care at this point.

131
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:08,553
Now, let's go into, let's
just go into titanium white,

132
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:10,503
I'm gonna put the least
little bit of black into it

133
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:13,088
just to grey it down a little bit.

134
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:14,992
Something about like that.

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,985
Maybe even a little tiny
bit of the bright red.

136
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:21,459
Pull it out as flat as you can get it.

137
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,987
Cut across and get that
little roll of paint again.

138
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:27,860
It lives right out at
the edge of the knife.

139
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:30,189
And maybe, tell you what,

140
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,721
let's have the light
coming from the left today,

141
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,899
what the heck?

142
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:34,363
Or maybe in your world, you want it

143
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,603
coming from the other direction.

144
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:36,087
It don't matter.

145
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:39,329
It doesn't matter, however you want it.

146
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,862
Totally and completely up to you.

147
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:44,499
And just sort of wiggling the
knife back and forth here,

148
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:47,273
I wanna make a nice, ridge that comes

149
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:49,625
right on down like that

150
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:51,888
and let it blend outward.

151
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:54,755
No pressure, absolutely no pressure.

152
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,200
There, just think about where
light would zing through here.

153
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,836
And sometimes I use the little knife

154
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,809
'cause you can get in there
and put more detail in it.

155
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:10,035
But right here we have a
very limited amount of time.

156
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,862
Shoot, I've got a mean old director,

157
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,962
if I don't finish in 30 minutes,
she has no sense of humor.

158
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:17,279
Absolutely none.

159
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,149
There we go.

160
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:21,266
So we'll use the big knife,

161
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:23,067
but when you're painting at home,

162
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,530
find the tools and equipment that are

163
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,270
most comfortable to you

164
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,996
and that's the ones you wanna use.

165
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,562
That's the ones.

166
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:32,319
Alright, we take a little white,

167
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,392
put a little thalo blue in it.

168
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,209
We'll make a shadow color,

169
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:37,324
I'm gonna add a little black, too,

170
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:38,572
just to dull it down.

171
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,335
Just to dull it down a little bit.

172
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,730
There, nice shadow color,

173
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,262
same way, cut off a little roll of paint

174
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:48,737
and we go right up in here

175
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,716
and begin thinking where
shadows would live.

176
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,240
Light's coming from the left,

177
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,133
where's all these gorgeous little shadows

178
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:56,951
gonna live in your mountain?

179
00:06:57,572 --> 00:06:59,406
There, now one thing you'll find,

180
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:01,043
if you're right-handed,

181
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:04,584
normally it's easier to
have the light coming from

182
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:05,995
the right.

183
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:07,864
Normally.

184
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:10,732
And I say normally because
we're all different.

185
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,954
What's easy for one
person is a son of a gun

186
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,729
for the next person, so it's up to you.

187
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,244
Try it both ways, see what happens.

188
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:20,558
But now if you're left handed,

189
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,765
it's a whole different story

190
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:26,363
because I find, as Anette and
I travel all over and teach,

191
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,440
we find that left-handed
people have been forced

192
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,109
all their life to do right-handed things

193
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,812
and for that reason,
sometimes left-handed people

194
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:39,449
prefer to highlight on
the left or the right.

195
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,533
It's very individual.

196
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:43,704
Very individual.

197
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:46,322
My brother Jim was left-handed

198
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:48,261
and I grew up with him,
so I'm used to working

199
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,112
with left-handed people.

200
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,980
There, (chuckling) when we were kids,

201
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,559
we used to fight like cats and dogs,

202
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,126
you know how brothers are.

203
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,966
And I never expected
that left hand to get me.

204
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:00,586
Boy, he used to sock me.

205
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:04,504
Now he grew up and, he's bigger,

206
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:06,891
I hope he doesn't remember all that.

207
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:08,992
There we go.

208
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:10,851
He's a good man, though.

209
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:12,796
He's my best friend in the whole world.

210
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:14,863
There.

211
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,324
Something about like that,
and you just let this go

212
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:18,984
wherever you want it.

213
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:21,387
Maybe it comes right on down,

214
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:24,788
just let your imagination
take you to anywhere

215
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:26,141
that you wanna be.

216
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:28,562
Anywhere, just sorta let
those blend together,

217
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:30,490
the highlights and the shadows.

218
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,980
Gently, gently, gently work 'em together.

219
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:37,072
And we can use a little
blender brush here.

220
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:40,610
Just tap it gently and very lightly.

221
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,658
This blender brush is
so great for softening.

222
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,413
There, don't know why I waited
so long to introduce it,

223
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:50,653
we just introduced this, I
think, in the last series,

224
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:52,426
it's relatively a new brush.

225
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:56,954
Just wonderful, just some of
the most fantastic effects.

226
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:02,448
There, alright, we're in business.

227
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,083
Tell you what, let's have some fun.

228
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,340
Go back, let's use the
old two inch brush today,

229
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,740
what the heck?

230
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,755
I'm gonna go right into
the mountain color.

231
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,014
Well, I'll change it a little,

232
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,692
I'm gonna add a little sap green to it.

233
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,145
Little sap green to it,

234
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:19,996
just to change its flavor a little bit.

235
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:23,555
I'm tapping the brush
firmly right into the paint,

236
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:26,421
'cause I'm gonna paint,
I think I'll paint today,

237
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:28,117
show you how to use just the top corner

238
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:30,788
of an old two inch
brush and do some things

239
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,827
that are unbelievable, come right up here.

240
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:36,653
Now, take the top corner
and begin tapping in

241
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:39,320
some basic little tree shapes.

242
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:41,956
We're not looking for detail yet.

243
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:46,203
All we're looking for is basic, basic

244
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:49,565
tree shapes and forms,
that's all we're looking for.

245
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,059
They live right here in front
of this gorgeous mountain,

246
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:54,535
what a view.

247
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,249
What a view, I lived in
Alaska a dozen years or more

248
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,493
and I think, as I've
said in some other shows,

249
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,658
God was having a good
day when he made Alaska.

250
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:08,688
There are some days,
it's like when you paint,

251
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:11,567
some days you can't do anything wrong,

252
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,739
everything works for you.

253
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,269
And I think God was
having one of those days

254
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:17,982
when he made Alaska,

255
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:21,697
some of the most gorgeous
scenery I've ever seen.

256
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:25,009
There we go. See?

257
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:27,019
Just using the top corner of
this little two inch brush

258
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:29,695
to tap in all these little basic shapes.

259
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:32,132
There's not right, there's no wrong.

260
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:36,652
There, all you do is drop 'em in

261
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,591
and even here, you begin making out,

262
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:40,634
see there's all kind of
little things happening,

263
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:43,385
don't cover them up, leave 'em in there,

264
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:44,833
they become your friend.

265
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,371
Shoot, I like these old big trees.

266
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:50,351
Let's have another one over here.

267
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,929
Something about like that.

268
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:55,227
There.

269
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,784
There we go, see?

270
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,716
Just, once again, basic, very basic shape,

271
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:05,460
think like a tree, just think like a tree.

272
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:09,278
How's the tree's arms, how
do they hang off the sides?

273
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:12,221
Look at trees, make friends with trees,

274
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:14,553
study 'em, study 'em,

275
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:17,312
go out in your yard and talk to a tree,

276
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,646
what the heck?

277
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:21,067
Your neighbors might look at you like

278
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,841
you're a little strange, but
tell 'em you're an artist,

279
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,543
they'll understand that.

280
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,526
Now, while we have this
little brush going here,

281
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:30,679
down here in the bottom in this black,

282
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,659
I want a little bluish color.

283
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:35,220
Little bluish color,
I'm gonna take a little

284
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,120
of the Prussian blue, just
a little Prussian blue,

285
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,057
and just add a little blue
right in here, not much.

286
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:43,288
Not much.

287
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:48,002
Start at the bottom and
let it blend upward.

288
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,418
You're not looking for a lot of blue here,

289
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,678
just a little.

290
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,081
Just a little.

291
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:57,355
About like that.

292
00:11:58,244 --> 00:11:59,922
And maybe in our world

293
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,517
back in here, we'll take
a little paint thinner,

294
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,951
remember our golden rule,

295
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,787
thin paint will stick to a thick paint,

296
00:12:06,787 --> 00:12:09,585
so I'm gonna take a little dark sienna,

297
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,256
least little touch of white in it.

298
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:15,423
Okay, let's go up in here and maybe,

299
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:18,687
yep, you're right, here
and there the indication,

300
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:22,936
just the indication of a
little tree trunk stem,

301
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,096
whatever you wanna call it,

302
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:26,035
that lives right here, limbs and branches,

303
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:26,938
whatever.

304
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:28,969
But they live in these trees.

305
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,234
They live in there.

306
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,604
And take a little light color,

307
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:34,307
we said our light was
coming from the left,

308
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:36,116
so the left side, you can
make it a little lighter

309
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:37,260
if you want to.

310
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,129
See there?

311
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,420
Now most of this we're gonna
end up covering up with leaves,

312
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:44,890
but some of it'll show
through and it'll be gorgeous

313
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,050
and people, when they
look at your painting,

314
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:48,525
shoot, they'll think you spent

315
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:50,289
half your life doing this painting, shh,

316
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:51,875
don't tell 'em no different.

317
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:56,059
Alright, we'll go, let's
just keep using the same old

318
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:57,798
two inch brush, I left
the dirty color on it,

319
00:12:57,798 --> 00:12:59,150
went right into yellow.

320
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:02,523
There's black and blue in this color,

321
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:04,334
so when you touch the yellow,

322
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,644
automatically, you're gonna get all these

323
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:09,625
gorgeous hues of green,
let's go up in here.

324
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,214
Now, go slightly above the dark

325
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:14,420
and take this color and very gently,

326
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,416
just using the top corner of the brush,

327
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:19,086
that's all, little yellow,
ochre and Indian yellow

328
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:21,758
here and there, just the top corner

329
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:25,229
begin tapping in all
these little basic shapes.

330
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,186
If you have trouble
making the paint stick,

331
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:30,532
add the least little
touch of paint thinner.

332
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:33,286
Just a little paint thinner.

333
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,481
There.

334
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,924
See there? Did you ever
think you could paint

335
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:40,605
all this detail just using the
corner of a two inch brush?

336
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:41,557
It looks like something you've painted

337
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:42,971
the barn with last week.

338
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,451
You can do that, you can do anything

339
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,117
that you believe you can do.

340
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:50,009
And I know you can do this,

341
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,806
so certainly if I know
it, you know it, too.

342
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:53,758
Going to a little yellow
ochre, and I want to touch

343
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:57,924
a bright red once in awhile,
just to change the flavor.

344
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:59,880
Ooh, I like that one, I like that one.

345
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:01,610
That's a nice one.

346
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,633
Very nice color.

347
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,682
That'd warm up any room right there.

348
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:10,971
There, and begin working
on little individual trees

349
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:13,837
and bushes and things
that live all in here.

350
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,742
Just think about all these little guys,

351
00:14:15,743 --> 00:14:17,592
give 'em names if necessary.

352
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:21,150
Give 'em names, this is
Clyde, he lives right here.

353
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,350
Like that, like that, see?

354
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,900
Darker, darker, darker.

355
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:31,613
Just let 'em get way
back in there, like that.

356
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:35,764
As I've mentioned frequently,
when you're painting,

357
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:38,504
I find it helps a great deal
to make up little stories

358
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,949
about your painting.

359
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:43,531
Think about, think about this area,

360
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,666
would you like to live there?

361
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,745
Maybe somebody does live there.

362
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,043
There we go, make up
little stories about it.

363
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:51,716
Maybe there's a little
animal that lives here

364
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:54,137
that's your friend and
you know him very well.

365
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,690
Talk about him, there.

366
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,269
Something like that.

367
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,797
Now, got another old big tree over here,

368
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:07,636
it needs a little bit, there.

369
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:10,496
We'll just put a little
in there, I'm gonna dip a

370
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:12,133
least little touch of paint thinner,

371
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:13,989
just to make it a little thinner.

372
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,435
There, see? Goes on so much easier.

373
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,501
And you have to do that
every once in awhile.

374
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:23,300
Especially if the paint's
the same consistency.

375
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:28,019
There, okay, darker, darker, darker

376
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,138
as it works down, darker and darker.

377
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,150
That helps create the
illusion of shadows and stuff

378
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,375
down in here.

379
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:37,673
Maybe in here is some dark little bushes.

380
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,393
They just live in here,
wherever you want 'em.

381
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,277
There they are.

382
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,704
Alright.

383
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:48,205
Now sometimes you can take this brush,

384
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:50,609
get a little red on it,
and you can just sorta

385
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,709
take the corner of it and
move it back and forth, see?

386
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:57,177
Just the corner, what a good shot, there.

387
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:59,278
See? Just take it back and forth.

388
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:00,649
And now, when you go up here and touch it,

389
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,681
it'll make little pointy things.

390
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:04,353
See? They got little points on 'em

391
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:07,005
and it sorta, it sorta changes the flavor.

392
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,012
Gives you a bush that's a
little different right in there.

393
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:14,752
Okay, take a little bit
of the reddish col--

394
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:18,217
ooh, I like that one, little
firecracker right there.

395
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,388
Little old firecracker.

396
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:26,010
There we go, and just very back and forth

397
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,509
between the greens and the yellows

398
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:28,989
and all these little colors.

399
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,617
But each one of these layers creates

400
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,717
a different plane in your painting

401
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:37,800
and that's what creates that
illusion of depth and distance.

402
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,042
There we go.

403
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:42,538
Shoot, let's have some fun.

404
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:46,259
Let's have some fun,
we can clean off a spot

405
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:47,230
to work here.

406
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,432
Let's take black, little
bit of the Prussian blue,

407
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:55,172
some brown, thalo green,
I like thalo green,

408
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:56,687
we'll make some evergreens.

409
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,478
There, a little crimson in
there too, what the heck?

410
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,808
It's our world, we can
do anything we want.

411
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,591
We wipe our knife off.

412
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,460
i just wipe the knife
on an old paper towel.

413
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:10,524
Go back into our color with a fan brush.

414
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,649
Load a lot of paint in the brush,

415
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,973
lotta paint, lotta paint.

416
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:18,893
Maybe in our world there lives

417
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:21,459
an evergreen tree right there.

418
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,325
There he is, you knew he
was there, didn't you?

419
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,032
Now when you're doing this, sometimes

420
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:27,365
to go over all the paint
that's in your mountain,

421
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:29,396
it gets a little difficult,
it don't wanna stick.

422
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:32,903
If that's the case, add
the least little touch

423
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:35,341
of paint thinner, just dip
the corner of your brush

424
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,347
into a little paint thinner,
then go back through your paint

425
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:40,019
and it'll the soften the
paint, make it thinner,

426
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,016
so it slides right on there.

427
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:46,342
Enough of them little ones,
we need a big old tree.

428
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:48,746
And he lives right in there somewhere.

429
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:51,955
There, see you can go on over this,

430
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:54,323
sometimes you need to add a little thinner

431
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,095
'cause a thin paint will
stick to a thick paint.

432
00:17:57,095 --> 00:17:59,336
And that way it'll go
right over the top of it

433
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:01,367
without any problem

434
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:04,606
and without all coming together.

435
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:05,558
We'll put one more in there

436
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:07,259
and then we'll quit over this way.

437
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:09,505
I just like to do evergreen trees,

438
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,625
I think they're one of the
most fun trees to paint.

439
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:13,250
And they're very easy.

440
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,129
Let's put one on the other side.

441
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,614
Artistically, it looks better
if you have an odd number.

442
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:23,376
Now, I know nature doesn't know that rule

443
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:25,559
and you're gonna tell me
you looked out the other day

444
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,067
and saw and even number
of trees in your yard,

445
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,123
I know that's true,

446
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:32,896
but artistically, it does
look a little better.

447
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:36,472
But if you wanna have an even
number of trees in your world,

448
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,338
that's your business

449
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:40,928
and it's your tree and
your world and you do it

450
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:42,258
any way that you want.

451
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:45,270
Alright, now let's take a little white,

452
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,067
little bit of Van Dyke and
dark sienna mixed in there.

453
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,585
And let's just put us a
indication here and there

454
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:56,720
little bit of tree trunk, it lives there,

455
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,844
I don't want a lot over here

456
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:06,028
Just a little, just indications,
maybe even back in there

457
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:07,855
is a little.

458
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,655
Wherever you think they should live.

459
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:13,038
We can take that same old
brush, go back through

460
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,406
'cause it has the tree color on him.

461
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,276
Go back over some cad
yellow and yellow ochre,

462
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:19,715
little Indian yeller, yellow.

463
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,925
Lotta color, let's go back up in here.

464
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:25,121
Our light's coming in from the left

465
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,921
so we wanna emphasize
the left side of the tree

466
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:28,274
a little more than the right.

467
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,319
There we go, and just begin
dropping in a few highlights,

468
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,593
don't overdo, you'll lose
all this gorgeous darkness

469
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:37,336
and evergreens are normally,

470
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:42,336
normally, I say, a little
bit darker than other trees.

471
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:44,493
There they go.

472
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,163
Something about like that,
darker, darker, darker.

473
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,409
Now, let's go into Van Dyke brown.

474
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,528
Time to get crazy here.

475
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:54,344
Maybe in our world there lives some dirt,

476
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:58,669
big rocks, stones, all
kinda things, right here.

477
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,665
That easy.

478
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,640
That easy.

479
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:04,532
There.

480
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,480
Alright, maybe comes right on out in here.

481
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:12,826
We talk a little of that,
that was that brown and white

482
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:15,445
we had left over from the tree trunks.

483
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:18,380
We just pull something
out like that, like that.

484
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:21,439
Now, we'll take a lighter brown and white

485
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,610
maybe that one was in shadow,

486
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:25,211
just sorta make up little things,

487
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:29,287
and here, this one here,
is a little bit stronger,

488
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,173
little bit more light hittin' that.

489
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:34,290
Just let the knife barely
touch, bounce along there,

490
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,408
barely touching, barely, barely touching.

491
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,057
Alright, take and just
grab it here and there

492
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:43,585
and sort of pull it down

493
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:47,009
and make it look like a big,
strong bank right there.

494
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:49,123
That easy.

495
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,862
Our fan brush that has the
greens on it and stuff,

496
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:56,207
we just take it and
pop in, pushing upward,

497
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,447
pop in the indication,
little bushes and things

498
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:00,962
that live right out in here.

499
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:03,112
Now, let's have some fun,

500
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:04,657
I'm gonna take a little bit of black,

501
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:05,817
put some paint thinner with it,

502
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:08,522
and make it very thin,
I want a thin paint.

503
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:12,153
Little bit of black, put
some brown in there, too,

504
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,344
black and brown.

505
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,064
Okay, but it's very thin,

506
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:18,951
it's got a lot of paint thinner in it.

507
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:23,774
Now, I wanna take some
brown and some white,

508
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:26,573
little black in it, and
we'll make a lighter color

509
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,925
that's also very thin.

510
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:30,707
That's all there is to it, just put

511
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:31,876
a little paint thinner with it.

512
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,565
We'll take our little filbert brush.

513
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:39,234
We'll go right through the dark,

514
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,791
load both sides full of dark,

515
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,019
and I'm gonna go right down here,

516
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:44,405
pull only one side through the light.

517
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,989
And with that, in one stroke,

518
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:49,055
you can make all kinds
of little indications

519
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:53,403
of little rocks and stones that
live back in here like that.

520
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:57,875
Now, little bit, and I say that again,

521
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,436
a little bit of titanium
white on the two inch brush,

522
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:03,230
I wanna keep this quite dark,

523
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:06,615
just touch and pull downward,

524
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:09,145
pull downward

525
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:10,454
a little bit.

526
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,515
Just enough, just enough to show.

527
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:18,719
I want this water to be
very dark, mysterious water

528
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:21,258
so that liquid black comes in so great.

529
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,515
It makes wonderful,
wonderful effects like that.

530
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,983
Little while, little thalo blue

531
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:32,411
and then we'll just take,
and just touch the canvas.

532
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:36,476
This is thick paint, normally
I use a thin, thin paint

533
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:37,922
to do water lines.

534
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,051
This one's much thicker,

535
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:43,563
all I'm doing is just touching,
just touch the canvas.

536
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,787
The canvas will take off what it wants,

537
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:47,586
give you back what's left,

538
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:50,084
just like a tax man does,

539
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:52,279
(chuckles) just like he
does with my paycheck.

540
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,722
Yeah, he just takes off what he wants

541
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:57,782
and what's left, it isn't much.

542
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:01,324
Alright, back into our dark color.

543
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,742
That was mostly, we
had some Prussian blue,

544
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:07,679
I think black, brown,
little sap green, crimson,

545
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,219
doesn't matter.

546
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,923
Let's put a little projections
that comes out of this side.

547
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:14,645
And all I'm doing is
putting some dark color on

548
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:17,365
so our light will show.

549
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:19,537
Something about like that.

550
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:23,240
We don't know where it goes,
don't know that we care.

551
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,691
I got another two inch
brush here that I was using

552
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:29,268
that has green on it and with that,

553
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,538
yeah, look, look, look,

554
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:35,205
we'll put in, just tapping,
follow the angles though,

555
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,953
follow angles, most important.

556
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,942
A little more of the
yellow ochre in that one,

557
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:42,132
just enough to change
the flavor a little bit.

558
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,376
There, see? Put all these
little things in here

559
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:46,659
wherever you want 'em.

560
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,296
Wherever you want 'em.

561
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:51,095
Something about like that.

562
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,221
There we go.

563
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:55,357
And you can change angles and stuff

564
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:57,726
and all kinds of things will happen.

565
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,956
Back to our blue and white on a knife.

566
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:02,532
And let's put a little water
line right around there.

567
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,750
That sorta just brings it all together,

568
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,705
keep it dark, though, very, very dark.

569
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,009
Our filbert brush, I wanna
put a rock over there,

570
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:13,221
I like these little rocks,
they're the most fun to make.

571
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,528
Bloop, bloop, bloop, one
stroke and they're in.

572
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:19,235
That's all there is to it.

573
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:23,442
Shoot, I think with that, we're
about ready for a signature

574
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:26,147
on this one, take a little
red, little paint thinner.

575
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:28,121
We'll call this little painting finished.

576
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:29,526
Hope you've enjoyed it,

577
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:31,756
it's a nice way to use the liquid black,

578
00:24:31,756 --> 00:24:34,066
give you a lot of experience.

579
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:36,596
I think with that, we're
gonna call this one done.

580
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,570
And from all of us here,
I'd like to wish you

581
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,298
happy painting and God bless, my friend.

582
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:46,298
(smooth jazz music)
