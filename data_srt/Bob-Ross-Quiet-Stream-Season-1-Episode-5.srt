1
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:05,256
- Well welcome back, glad
to see you again today.

2
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,206
I thought today we'd do
something a little different

3
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:09,606
and I've taken the liberty of going ahead

4
00:00:09,606 --> 00:00:12,094
and covering the canvas
with a complete layer

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,762
of Sap Green.

6
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:16,823
And to that I'm gonna add
a little Prussian Blue

7
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:18,173
right on the bottom here.

8
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:20,572
And we just start at
the bottom and work up

9
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:24,233
so that it gets lighter
and lighter as we go up.

10
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,233
There we go.

11
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,462
I thought today we'd make
a happy little stream,

12
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:31,283
it's just sort of running
through the woods here.

13
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:32,115
There.

14
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,719
Okay, we just work this
blue back and forth

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,810
so it graduates in value as it goes up.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,393
(gentle music)

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,612
Okay.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,750
Now,

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,109
let's take, let's use this brush.

20
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,210
We'll take a little bit of Cadmium Yellow

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,520
and let's make a light source in here.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,420
And we'll just do this by
making little X patterns.

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,420
There we go.

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,683
Just work it around and round and round

25
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:09,157
so it gets it darker and darker

26
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,739
as it goes out from the center.

27
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:16,387
Maybe a touch more.

28
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:20,822
Always starting in the light
area and working outward.

29
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:21,822
There we go.

30
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:28,209
Just back and forth, little Xs.

31
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:34,956
Okay.

32
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:36,666
Now we'll take the big brush,

33
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,750
and very gently we'll hypnotize this.

34
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:41,459
There.

35
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:44,683
Just let it blend outward.

36
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:51,216
So that we sort of have a light source,

37
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:54,049
that's all we're looking for here.

38
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:56,977
Now still using the big brush,

39
00:01:56,977 --> 00:02:00,227
we'll go right back into the Sap Green.

40
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:03,846
And we'll do some basic tree shapes here.

41
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:08,106
We push the paint into the
canvas, just really push it.

42
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:09,106
There we go.

43
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:12,847
And you need an almighty
easel when you're doing this

44
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:14,707
because you're really, really pressing

45
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:17,076
the paint into the canvas.

46
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,659
(gentle music)

47
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,560
Okay.

48
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:30,766
Maybe we'll have another
big tree right in here.

49
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:33,757
Okay, there it is.

50
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:37,387
Isn't that fantastic, that
you can just push a tree

51
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:40,219
right out of your brush like that?

52
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,733
We'll have another tree here.

53
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,566
No use stopping,

54
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:51,483
we're having so much fun
here with these trees.

55
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:56,288
Okay.

56
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:00,734
And already we have a
basic shape to work with.

57
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:02,002
We really don't plan these paintings,

58
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,532
we let them happen,

59
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:05,992
we just sort of decide
where we want basic shapes

60
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:08,451
and work from there.

61
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:11,301
Okay, let's take the almighty knife,

62
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:15,384
a little Van Dyke Brown
and white mixed together.

63
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:19,657
And we'll put some trunks
on these almighty trees.

64
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,097
And all we're gonna do is touch

65
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:23,257
and sort of pull a little bit.

66
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:25,840
It'll get wider as you go down.

67
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,236
There we are.

68
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:31,986
(upbeat guitar music)

69
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:33,727
And maybe we'll have another trunk

70
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,227
hiding back in here somewhere.

71
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:43,384
Just make all kind of little
tree things happen here.

72
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,296
This is sort of different
than the paintings

73
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:48,366
we've done previously,
because this painting

74
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,376
has no Magic White on it.

75
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:52,724
All we do is start with the Sap Green,

76
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:54,643
completely cover the canvas,

77
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:57,134
work the Prussian blue
from the bottom upward

78
00:03:57,133 --> 00:04:00,133
to make it darker in the foreground.

79
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:06,134
These are the kind of things
that we continually look for,

80
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:10,300
new ideas, new ways of using
this fantastic technique.

81
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,954
And these ideas we put out continually

82
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,524
to all the people that
enjoy this type of painting,

83
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,298
we have a little quarterly
newsletter that we use

84
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,173
to put these ideas out to people

85
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:26,983
so they are current in what's happening.

86
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,723
Okay, let's just have
another almighty trunk

87
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,723
right down through here.

88
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,103
Maybe we'll highlight
these just a little bit,

89
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:38,923
with a little plain white.

90
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:40,391
Just think where the light would strike

91
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,201
and run through here and have fun.

92
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:45,681
(jazzy guitar music)

93
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
There we go.

94
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,911
And over on this side now,

95
00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:54,860
the light's gonna come from
the opposing direction,

96
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,777
the opposite direction.

97
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:01,177
Just a little here and there.

98
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:07,424
Okay.

99
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:11,540
Now we'll take a one inch brush

100
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,911
and a little bit of Magic White.

101
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,440
And we'll start with some yellow

102
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,857
and a touch of Phthalo Green.

103
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:23,331
Remember that a thin paint
will stick to a thick paint

104
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:24,688
so we thinned it just a little bit

105
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:27,267
with a little Magic White,
and then we just push out

106
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:30,477
all these thousands of little leaves.

107
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:31,918
There they come.

108
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,168
There they are.

109
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,717
Isn't that fantastic?

110
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:37,768
If you're painting along with us,

111
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,627
by now you should begin
to have little leaves

112
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:43,137
all over these trees, just
beautiful little leaves.

113
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,757
Leave a lot of the dark areas in here,

114
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:47,397
we don't want to kill all the dark areas.

115
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:51,388
We need the dark in
order to show the light.

116
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:52,221
There.

117
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,498
Okay, maybe we'll come right down here

118
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:58,664
and drop in another happy little bush.

119
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:02,381
There they come.

120
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,178
And over in here.

121
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:08,067
You want this to be the
brightest area in the painting,

122
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,587
back here where the light source is.

123
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:12,388
As we work forward, we're gonna get darker

124
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,221
and darker and darker.

125
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,201
Mmm-kay.

126
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:23,921
Maybe a little light coming
through right in here.

127
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:25,812
Now put your trunk in before
you put the leaves though,

128
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:27,822
so you have leaves in front of the trunk,

129
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:31,988
you don't want the trunk sitting
on the outside of the tree.

130
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:34,115
Okay.

131
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:38,325
There's a nice little bush, there he is.

132
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:46,901
And maybe over here, just
happy little thing growing.

133
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,391
Nature's so fantastic, enjoy it.

134
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:51,891
Let it, let it make you happy.

135
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,928
Okay, there's another one.

136
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,478
Now I'm gonna go into a little Sap Green,

137
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,668
begin using a little Sap
Green with this yellow

138
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:08,168
so it begins to get a little
darker as we work back here.

139
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:11,108
And we'll put some highlights
on this little tree.

140
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:14,275
(gentle guitar music)

141
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:18,348
There we go.

142
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,038
By now you should begin having the feeling

143
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:26,528
that you're walking through the deep woods

144
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,848
of all the beautiful
tree shapes are there,

145
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:32,385
the little squirrels
are hiding in the trees,

146
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,802
the bunny rabbits are behind.

147
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:36,915
There we go.

148
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,415
Once again, don't kill all this dark area,

149
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:42,415
you need it to produce
distance in the painting.

150
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:47,588
Okay.

151
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:51,975
That should give us enough
to get started with.

152
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,886
Now we'll take the almighty fan brush

153
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:57,091
and we'll take a little
bit of Magic White,

154
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:59,281
and a little bit of Firm White.

155
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:02,881
And we'll make a, let's
have a little waterfall

156
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,380
that's happening back here,

157
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,000
and maybe a bubbling little stream

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,640
is just working its way through.

159
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:10,831
So often we avoid running water,

160
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:14,521
running water is a lot
of fun, so here we go.

161
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,021
Pull it over, and let it drop,

162
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,821
if you're making a little waterfall.

163
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:20,581
Then we take the fan brush and push,

164
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:24,061
makes the little foamy things happen.

165
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,680
Then we begin building our running water,

166
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,810
and we're pushing the fan
brush so that it bends upward

167
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,020
and the foam's on the top
instead of on the bottom.

168
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:32,850
There we are.

169
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,183
Let all these little things just happen.

170
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,160
Mmm, there we go.

171
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,930
Maybe under the water here,
there's a little stones,

172
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,811
causing the water to
sort of just bubble over.

173
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:49,978
You might not see this
stone, but it's under there.

174
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,240
As it comes towards you, let it get wider,

175
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,221
bigger, stronger.

176
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,270
More of these little things,

177
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,570
little actions that are happening here.

178
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,918
(gentle guitar music)

179
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,977
All kinds of little churning motions.

180
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,137
And avoid having your waterfall here

181
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:11,018
and stream coming straight
through your painting,

182
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,435
let it sort of wander around.

183
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,457
All these little water actions.

184
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:22,987
And they all hide here in your fan brush,

185
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:26,655
all you have to do is
sort of push them out.

186
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:35,215
Okay, good.

187
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,128
Alrighty, maybe

188
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:44,490
maybe back here in the distance there's,

189
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,240
we have a little stone back here.

190
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:49,508
We just use some Van Dyke brown

191
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,341
and we'll build us a little stone.

192
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:57,307
And maybe there's a
little stone out here too.

193
00:09:57,307 --> 00:10:01,475
This is your world, so you
put stones wherever you want.

194
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,307
This painting comes right of your heart,

195
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:09,008
so just let it sort of flow.

196
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,743
Let it happen.

197
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,618
Maybe we'll take a little
bit of brown and white and

198
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,538
the least little touch of blue.

199
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:19,538
Just to make sort of a grey color here.

200
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:24,307
And we can highlight these
little stones, just like that.

201
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:28,475
Maybe there's a little ridge
coming down through here.

202
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:35,048
Little sunlight playing across the stones.

203
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,028
A little dark edge underneath here,

204
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,677
so that it has some distance

205
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:41,345
between the water and the stone.

206
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:46,538
And we take the little fan brush,

207
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:50,138
and splash some water up
on the stones there, there.

208
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:51,138
There we go.

209
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:56,258
Okay, maybe we'll let this

210
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:59,425
just drift right on down through here.

211
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,028
Maybe right along here, there's another

212
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,008
happy little waterfall
that's happening right here.

213
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:08,348
So you take your fan
brush, and go straight,

214
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:10,807
and let it just fall over.

215
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:12,128
Just like so.

216
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:13,298
Isn't that something?

217
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,298
You can make a waterfall that quick.

218
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,577
Just a small one, you don't want

219
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:21,019
to have a violent waterfall here,

220
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,519
just a little bitty waterfall.

221
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,810
And then we push to make
our little foamy areas

222
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:30,309
where the waterfall's gonna hit and crash.

223
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,860
There we go.

224
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,840
Okay, now let's take the big brush again

225
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,027
and use some Sap Green and Prussian Blue.

226
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:50,644
It's getting darker as it comes down.

227
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,811
And we'll throw in some more
happy little bushes back here.

228
00:11:57,394 --> 00:12:01,504
You need the dark in
order to show the light.

229
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:05,433
(gentle guitar music)

230
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,673
Okay, maybe over here
there's a nice bush too.

231
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:12,841
Let some of these bushes
protrude out over the water.

232
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:17,396
Okay.

233
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:22,803
Now we can take a little
more of the highlight color,

234
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:24,093
some Cad Yellow with a little bit

235
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:27,064
of Phthalo and Sap Green mixed together.

236
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,653
I'm gonna start back
here and push this rock

237
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:31,083
back into the painting.

238
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,543
We just put a little bush in front of it.

239
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:34,543
There we go.

240
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,423
And maybe right here there's
some nice little things

241
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:42,591
that just sort of hang over the water.

242
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:47,766
Okay, let's do this nice one right here.

243
00:12:57,964 --> 00:13:00,047
There we go, there we go.

244
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,508
You can do it, you can do it.

245
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:13,062
Just push that waterfall
right back into the painting.

246
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,798
Okay, let's

247
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:21,850
let's take a little more brown here

248
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,191
and just put a little stone,
a little gravel out here

249
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:28,024
for all these nice bushes
and stuff to sit on.

250
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,041
There we go.

251
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,390
Little highlight on the stones.

252
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,557
(gentle guitar music)

253
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,250
And a few little grassy things that grow

254
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,583
right on down the bank here.

255
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:57,519
Maybe we'll even get daring

256
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,269
and put a little stone
out here in the water.

257
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:05,259
There.

258
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,569
Just lay it in with Van Dyke Brown,

259
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,950
then we highlight it with
sort of the grey color.

260
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,555
There, just let this bright play

261
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:16,387
just run across this little stone.

262
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:18,925
Okay.

263
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,984
Little more of the Magic
White, a little Firm White.

264
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:24,745
Now we're gonna start playing
the water around this stone.

265
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:26,695
Maybe it just comes around like so,

266
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:30,122
sort of falls over,
splashes a little here,

267
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:31,954
around the side, down.

268
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:42,235
All kinds of little
actions happening in this.

269
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:50,522
Okay, a little bit of water

270
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,522
splashing up against the rocks here.

271
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:03,301
Okay, now we're getting a
nice little stream here.

272
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,341
You can see how it's
beginning to pick up the blue

273
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,741
that's underneath here,
and make this water darker

274
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,908
as it comes closer to you.

275
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:16,841
There we go.

276
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:28,562
Okay, let's go back to
good old big brush here.

277
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,991
Little more blue and Sap Green.

278
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:34,891
And we'll project some bushes
right up through here now.

279
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:39,059
Need a lot of paint in the
brush, more green than blue.

280
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:45,572
And we just let these run
right on down like so.

281
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:48,654
(jazzy guitar music)

282
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,999
And we can highlight these with
a little yellow, Sap Green.

283
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:01,511
We're getting much darker in color now.

284
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:03,355
There.

285
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:11,101
Just sort of vary your color tones

286
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,531
back and forth a little so they stand out.

287
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,242
Leave the dark areas, that's
the only thing you have

288
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,491
to separate all these beautiful bushes.

289
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,629
Mm, there's a nice one.

290
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:28,292
Okay.

291
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,959
Add a little bush right in here.

292
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:42,975
Looks like some of the beautiful streams

293
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,893
that we have in Alaska.

294
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:50,028
Walk through the woods, and
you listen to, and you look at.

295
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:52,317
And they make you happy.

296
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:54,807
They have a beautiful sound to them.

297
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,787
You can almost hear the
bubbling and carrying on

298
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:59,954
as it travels down the creek bed here.

299
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:04,616
Just with the Van Dyke Brown
here, we're just adding

300
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:06,507
a few little sticks here and there,

301
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:08,923
you always have in the woods.

302
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,460
Okay.

303
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:18,116
Now we can take a clean knife

304
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:19,497
and just scrape through the dark areas

305
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,567
and let the canvas show through to give

306
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:24,086
the indication of all kind
of little sticks and twigs

307
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,420
that are going through here.

308
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:29,386
There they are.

309
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:38,187
Just using the point of the knife here.

310
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,181
And these little sticks create

311
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:43,182
tremendous distance in the painting.

312
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,757
So many of the fast painting techniques

313
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:49,197
that I have seen around the country

314
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,266
as I teach this almighty method,

315
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:55,100
are very flat, have very
little depth to them.

316
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,606
Okay, maybe now, we might
as well have some fun here.

317
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,826
Let's take some Van Dyke Brown,

318
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:11,396
and let's put an almighty dead
tree right up through here.

319
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,406
You always have dead trees in the woods

320
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:16,196
when you're walking around.

321
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,163
There.

322
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,913
Be brave, go right across
the waterfall here.

323
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:26,557
And we'll just lay this in with a knife.

324
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:30,437
We're using very thick paint here.

325
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,003
Right across the top.

326
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,803
And we'll just give him a little friend

327
00:18:37,804 --> 00:18:39,903
right beside him here.

328
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:42,903
This whole tree's just
about, just about had it.

329
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,770
He's gonna sort of fall over in the stream

330
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,890
and be washed away here pretty soon.

331
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:51,398
But until them, he's still
part of the beauty that's

332
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,314
ever-evident in nature.

333
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,900
We'll just make him a little taller,

334
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:06,067
that way he'll make a bigger
splash when he hits the water.

335
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:10,171
Okay.

336
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:13,047
Now I'm gonna use the liner brush

337
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,528
with a little bit of thin oil on it,

338
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:18,739
a little yellow and a little
Permanent Red mixed together,

339
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:22,879
we'll brighten this one up a little touch.

340
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:26,388
And I'm gonna just go
down the side of it here,

341
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:28,638
just highlighting a little.

342
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:34,369
We need something bright here,

343
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:37,035
so I'm gonna just use this tree.

344
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,559
There.

345
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,725
And let this sort of streak
so it looks like bark.

346
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,842
Okay, we'll wash him off.

347
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:58,338
And we'll use some more of the thin oil

348
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,229
and a little Van Dyke Brown,

349
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,999
and we'll put a few old branches

350
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:04,499
that are hanging on this tree.

351
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:10,548
Okay, and with the thin oil,
it makes the paint thinner.

352
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:13,278
So once again, you're working
with thin and thick paints,

353
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,759
the thin paint will stick
to the thicker paint.

354
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,979
And I recommend you use an oil,

355
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:22,338
if you use paint thinner
it has a tendency to bleed

356
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:25,038
if you're not very careful.

357
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:27,858
And the oil makes it much slicker.

358
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:28,858
There we go.

359
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:34,430
Mm, there we are.

360
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:40,535
Just a few old limbs here and there,

361
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:43,285
let's get a little more oil here.

362
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,894
And when you're working
this paint in the oil,

363
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:50,894
turn your brush, that
brings it to a nice point.

364
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:55,234
And you can make all these
delicate little limbs and stuff.

365
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:58,067
So put some over here on this one.

366
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,524
At home you have unlimited time,

367
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:10,775
here we're limited by our time factor,

368
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:14,942
but you can put tremendous
detail in these paintings.

369
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:19,144
So we're just trying to
give you an idea here,

370
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,365
we're just trying to give
you a guide to follow,

371
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:24,335
to teach you how to use
this fantastic technique.

372
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:28,625
And at home, let your
imagination be your guide,

373
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,555
let your heart take you
wherever you want to be.

374
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:35,721
(gentle guitar music)

375
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:40,775
There, look at all those little limbs.

376
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:43,442
And just in a matter of minutes.

377
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:51,391
Okay, maybe we'll have one
come in right through here.

378
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:53,505
There we go.

379
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:57,484
Just let them flow off your brush.

380
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,556
And this tree tends to push
everything back in the painting,

381
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:02,390
give it more distance.

382
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:08,735
And maybe there's just an
old hanging sort of here and

383
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:09,567
there.

384
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
There we go.

385
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:20,039
Okay, we'll take a little touch
more of the highlight color,

386
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,379
that's yellow with a
touch of Permanent Red.

387
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,690
And a little oil in it.

388
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,856
And we'll just highlight some
of these major limbs here.

389
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,486
Just let the brush flow
right down the limb.

390
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,539
If you have a problem,

391
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,819
maybe your hand's not
steady enough to do this,

392
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:42,986
use your palette or something
to sort of balance your hand.

393
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,000
I was very fortunate, I was
blessed with a very steady hand.

394
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,833
And

395
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,230
it comes in very handy when you're doing

396
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,360
these little delicate things.

397
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:56,942
(gentle music)

398
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,740
Okay, your little highlights over here.

399
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
There we go.

400
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,309
Just sort of work all this together.

401
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,223
Little bit right up here.

402
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:30,143
Okay, we'll clean out the brush here.

403
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,206
And let's see.

404
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:36,659
What do we need here?

405
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,250
I'm gonna pull this
down just a little bit,

406
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,309
to make it look a little, there we go.

407
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:44,069
A little more of a cliff right here.

408
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,486
Stone, very dark.

409
00:23:54,463 --> 00:23:55,783
Maybe right over here we'll build

410
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:59,294
a nice little stone right here too.

411
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:03,461
We have one in the water,
maybe we need one over here.

412
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:09,330
This is straight Van Dyke Brown again.

413
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:12,704
And we'll take a little touch

414
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:15,704
of the blue and the brown and white.

415
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,948
Okay.

416
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:30,115
Just lay this on very gently,
just let the paint break.

417
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,619
It's a very, very gentle touch.

418
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:36,201
Super gentle touch.

419
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:40,112
You almost let the knife touch.

420
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,828
Now we'll take a little
more of the Magic White,

421
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:49,739
a little green and yellow
and mix it together,

422
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,598
we'll make some little bushes here

423
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:53,368
to come up and protrude over the stone.

424
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,868
You need a thin paint to go over the top

425
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,708
of this very thick paint
that you've put on.

426
00:24:58,709 --> 00:24:59,959
So there we go.

427
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:08,785
And we put some little grassy
areas around the trees' foots.

428
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:11,961
Okay.

429
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,182
Alrighty.

430
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:21,255
(gentle guitar music)

431
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:31,438
And we wanna splash that
back up on the stone here.

432
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,272
Like so.

433
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:35,052
Okay.

434
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:37,453
Good, I think we just about

435
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,213
have our little stream finished today.

436
00:25:40,213 --> 00:25:43,525
And if you're painting along
with us, you should have

437
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,644
just about completed this painting.

438
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,223
I might put a few little
touches here and there.

439
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:49,813
As I say, at home you have time to put in

440
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:53,069
tremendous detail, you
can work and carry on

441
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:56,068
and build all kind of happy
little things in here.

442
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:58,918
Here, we're limited by
the amount of time we have

443
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,069
so we're just trying to show
you the basic technique,

444
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:03,318
the basic idea.

445
00:26:04,858 --> 00:26:06,448
Need a little highlight
on this little dead one

446
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:09,532
that's laying right out through here.

447
00:26:13,108 --> 00:26:14,578
Okay.

448
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:17,578
Just a little sticks here and there.

449
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:21,615
Little brighter color so they show up.

450
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:25,922
There's one right in front of the stone.

451
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:37,918
Okay, I think we'll just
take a little thin oil,

452
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,609
Permanent Red here, and
we'll sign this painting.

453
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:43,348
Little more oil.

454
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:45,936
(upbeat guitar music)

455
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:48,455
And I hope you've enjoyed this.

456
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:50,225
This is sort of a new idea.

457
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:52,176
As I say, we've used no
Magic White on this canvas,

458
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,395
just pure Sap Green.

459
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:55,955
This will work in a multitude of colors,

460
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,995
you can paint the canvas with blue,

461
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,996
with combinations of
colors, and make some of

462
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:03,156
the most fantastic little
paintings you've ever seen.

463
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,602
One of the prettiest
ones is to paint it with

464
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:08,472
Van Dyke Brown, and make
beautiful autumn scenes out of it.

465
00:27:08,472 --> 00:27:09,942
And the brown is picked up by the yellows

466
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:12,942
and oranges and reds and
just, it just stands out.

467
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:14,526
Fantastic painting.

468
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:16,686
Okay.

469
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:19,676
We'll just sign this one.

470
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:27,923
There we go.

471
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:34,230
(upbeat guitar music)

472
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,080
Yeah.

473
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,328
And we'll call that painting finished.

474
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,211
Once again, I hope you've
painted along with us,

475
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:46,271
and you've enjoyed this picture.

476
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:47,808
It is a lot of fun.

477
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:49,866
And we hope to see you again next time,

478
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,896
and we'll do another
happy little painting.

479
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:55,232
Until then, from all of
us here, happy painting.

480
00:27:55,232 --> 00:27:58,482
(upbeat guitar music)
