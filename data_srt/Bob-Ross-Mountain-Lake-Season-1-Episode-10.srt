1
00:00:01,225 --> 00:00:03,520
- Well hello, hope you
have your canvas set up

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,343
and ready to go, I think we'll
do another almighty picture.

3
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:08,955
And today, I wanna do
a ridge of mountains,

4
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:10,734
rather than the jagged, sharp mountains

5
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:11,772
that we've been doing,

6
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:14,753
I wanna do a nice, smooth
little ridge of mountains,

7
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:17,684
coming down into a beautiful little lake.

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,582
So we'll start off here

9
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:21,939
with a little bit of Prussian
blue on the big brush,

10
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,469
there we go, just work
it into the bristles,

11
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,386
and we'll start right at
the top of the canvas.

12
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:35,182
OK, we'll put us a quick
little sky in here,

13
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:41,456
and we'll just move this paint
around, let it work, play.

14
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:43,281
Don't want a dead sky.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,155
(calming piano music)

16
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:47,988
OK.

17
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,993
Now I've already had the
magic white on the canvas

18
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:52,661
before I started so,

19
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,388
we have that ready, there we go,

20
00:00:57,387 --> 00:01:00,467
just nice little sky with some life in it.

21
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:04,159
Now I put just a touch of
fatal green with my color,

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,492
and we'll put in some water.

23
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,239
There we go.

24
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,539
And sort of bring all that together.

25
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:22,049
We've left a little area open
right here in the center,

26
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,090
so that it'll look like a sheen of light

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,090
coming across the water.

28
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:27,855
OK.

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,930
(brush splashing in water)

30
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,347
(brush banging on metal)

31
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:40,473
There you go, just
redecorated your living room.

32
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:44,641
Now, let's take a little
bit of the titanium white,

33
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:48,210
and just a little touch
of permanent red in it,

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,256
always like to put a little
bit of pink into my clouds,

35
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:55,200
just so it looks like a little sunshine.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,012
And we'll do some
almighty big clouds here,

37
00:01:58,012 --> 00:02:00,359
just let em work off that brush,

38
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,709
keep the brush moving.

39
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,412
Keep it moving.

40
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:06,694
You don't wanna set and
grind one spot to death,

41
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:10,860
all you'll do is end up with
huge cotton balls in the sky.

42
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:14,531
And we want nice fluffy clouds.

43
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:17,373
Leave some of these areas dark,

44
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:20,977
that'll end up being the
shadows in your cloud.

45
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,536
OK.

46
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:24,313
There we go.

47
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:25,612
Maybe we'll just have a little cloud

48
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,780
floating around up in the sky up here.

49
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:31,520
There we are.

50
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:38,323
Now maybe another nice little cloud,

51
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:44,286
with just a little touch
more pink with that one.

52
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:45,687
There, now he stands out,

53
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:49,354
we just want these to
be soft little clouds.

54
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:54,793
OK.

55
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:56,017
Now we'll take the big brush,

56
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:57,883
and very gently hypnotize this,

57
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:01,383
just work it a little bit, leave it alone.

58
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,882
If you overwork it,
you've killed your cloud

59
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,948
and you've become a cloud killer,

60
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:10,717
ooh, nothing worse than a cloud killer.

61
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:13,673
There, fluff it up a little,

62
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:15,033
and don't worry if you pull little streaks

63
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,151
of paint out when you do that,

64
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,807
because when you hypnotize
it it'll go away.

65
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:23,807
There, we'll just hypnotize
the whole thing now.

66
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:29,336
OK let's clean the brush.

67
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:31,108
(brush splashing in water)

68
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,109
There we go.

69
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:39,421
And let's put one more
little cloud in there.

70
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,587
We'll just have him right
here, just let him work around.

71
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,665
If you're gonna separate these two clouds,

72
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:49,786
you need the dark area in between,

73
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:52,786
so don't kill all your darker area.

74
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:57,467
There, there.

75
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,917
Blend him in a little bit, fluff
him up, then hypnotize him.

76
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:07,651
OK.

77
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:11,929
Now let's start working on
this ridge of mountains here.

78
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:15,679
And we're gonna take a
little blue and brown,

79
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,137
I wanna make sort of a grey color here,

80
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,970
blue, brown and white.

81
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:30,783
And your blue is a hundred
times stronger than the brown,

82
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:32,449
so use it sparingly.

83
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:34,547
There we go.

84
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:43,060
Now, let's just take in, lay
us in a nice little ridge here,

85
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,927
and we're really pushing
this into the canvas,

86
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,793
work it hard, working hard.

87
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:51,126
Push, you're not gonna hurt that canvas.

88
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:59,268
Just a few little bumps
here and there on top.

89
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,358
We really push that color
into the canvas, there.

90
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:19,854
Now we take the big brush,
and we'll pull this downward.

91
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:20,855
There we go.

92
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:24,704
Get rid of all that excess paint.

93
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,336
And it's blending with the
magic white as you pull it down,

94
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,255
and automatically it gets lighter in value

95
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,755
toward the bottom.

96
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:36,587
OK.

97
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:45,553
OK, let's clean the old brush.

98
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:49,593
(brush banging on metal)

99
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:50,677
There we are.

100
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:55,201
Now, let's take a little bit of white,

101
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:56,731
and I'm gonna grey it a little bit,

102
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,732
just to make it a little bit duller.

103
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:08,058
And over here I'm gonna make
up a little shadow color,

104
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:11,975
and it's brown, white
and a little bit of blue,

105
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,644
so we can work back and forth

106
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:17,720
between highlights and shadows.

107
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,049
Little bitty, little
little bitty roll of paint

108
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,632
on your knife, almost no paint.

109
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:27,165
Want this to be very subdued.

110
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:29,365
There we go.

111
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:38,396
There, just let this come on down,

112
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:41,396
this should look almost like cliffs.

113
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:47,346
Just with a light striking here and there.

114
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:53,596
OK.

115
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:03,529
Little bit of the shadow
color played here and there.

116
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:21,787
I think you'll find that,
doing these kind of mountains,

117
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:23,442
are a little more difficult
than the other ones

118
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:27,156
we were doing, where we used more paint.

119
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:31,323
These here, almost non-existent
when it comes to paint.

120
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:34,257
OK.

121
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:37,855
Then we'll take the big
brush and diffuse this,

122
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:41,772
make it even softer, push
it even farther back.

123
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:44,328
Like so.

124
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:48,196
Really pushing back.

125
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:55,740
OK maybe we'll put a little ridge

126
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,877
coming right around here sorta.

127
00:07:58,877 --> 00:07:59,877
There we go.

128
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,958
You could spend all day
just playing with mountains,

129
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,717
and it's a super, super way to learn,

130
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:09,709
so, if you have an old
canvas around take it,

131
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:13,550
and just do nothing but
mountains on it, the whole thing.

132
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,548
It really, really will
make friend of that knife

133
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:19,644
by the time you're finished.

134
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:23,473
And it'll help you to
understand mountains,

135
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,959
everybody's not as fortunate
as I who can live in Alaska

136
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,564
where you can look out your window

137
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:31,730
and view mountains that most
people only see in pictures.

138
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:37,435
Alrighty, let's bring this down,

139
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:41,269
maybe we'll just have
it come right into here.

140
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:46,975
There we go.

141
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:59,588
OK, and if you don't have
mountains outside of your window,

142
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,512
you can buy a lot of books
that have pictures in it,

143
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:07,073
and examples, and after a
very short period of time

144
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:09,264
you'll begin making these
up in your own mind,

145
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:11,782
you no longer have to worry about copying,

146
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:14,282
but copying is a way to start.

147
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,102
In here we're trying
to give you something,

148
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:21,154
just sorta as a guideline to go by,

149
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:25,279
and to make your own vision,
and to put it on canvas.

150
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,115
So don't worry about
trying to copy exactly

151
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:30,682
what I'm doing here, do what you wanna do,

152
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:34,849
put your feelings into it,
your heart, it's your world.

153
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:39,850
OK.

154
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:45,782
And maybe a few little
things here and there.

155
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,278
A few little shadows.

156
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,208
And maybe we'll just
change some of these angles

157
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,084
here a little, there we
go, I like that better.

158
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,485
See it's your mountain, you can change it.

159
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:10,053
You can change it anyway
you want him to be.

160
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:11,837
We'll put some little
shadows here and there,

161
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:16,461
just to make some little
projections coming out,

162
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:18,962
wherever you want em.

163
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:19,795
OK.

164
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:25,035
Now, let's diffuse this,
lay it in the mist here.

165
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:27,908
Very soft.

166
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,127
Now I must take a little magic
white, little magic white.

167
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:42,276
We need a thinner paint,

168
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,427
if we're gonna make
some happy little clouds

169
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:47,812
that just sort of float
down over the mountain here,

170
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,506
and maybe we'll just
take this one right here,

171
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:53,697
and just let him float right
on down over the mountain.

172
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:58,028
Now, it's essential that you
have a thick paint on first,

173
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:01,182
it is essential, absolutely necessary,

174
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,504
or all you do is make mud here.

175
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:05,778
OK maybe there's a little cloud

176
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:09,028
just floating right down through there.

177
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,243
OK.

178
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:18,635
We just lay these clouds where we want em.

179
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:24,197
Heck, maybe this one
comes down over here too.

180
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:29,177
Very thin paint, can't stress that enough.

181
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:37,684
OK.

182
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,918
Now, very, very gently,

183
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:47,514
a hair just about touches,
not quite, just about.

184
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:49,849
There we go.

185
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:53,599
And then we'll hypnotize
it, ever so lightly.

186
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,442
Super, super lightly, there.

187
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,132
See how easy it is to put clouds

188
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:03,837
just drifting right over the mountain?

189
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:06,394
(brush splashing in water)

190
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:07,226
OK.

191
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:12,942
Now then, let's take, let's
take a little sap green,

192
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:18,299
and a little brown mixed together.

193
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,692
OK let's see here, let's take,

194
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,585
oh got a big old hair, and it
ain't right here on the brush.

195
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,264
If you get a hair on the canvas,

196
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:31,980
just take the corner of your
brush, and lift it right off.

197
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,096
No big deal.

198
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,518
If you take your finger and start picking

199
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:35,735
you'll destroy your whole picture

200
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:39,109
trying to get that one little
son of a gun off there.

201
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:41,940
OK now, we'll just lay in some color here,

202
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,634
maybe I'll add just a little
touch of blue to that.

203
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:47,716
Yeah, I like that better.

204
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,610
There we go.

205
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:06,811
OK, now then, we can
take and grab the hold

206
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:10,368
of a little bit of that, pull it down,

207
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,785
instant reflections, instant reflections.

208
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,987
Pull that across.

209
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,525
OK, now we can highlight a little bit,

210
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:30,170
we'll take a little
bit of the magic white,

211
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:34,490
a little yellow and a
touch of thalo green.

212
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,990
Nice bright little green here.

213
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:40,764
And, they'll lay in
some nice little things

214
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:43,181
happening all over the place.

215
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,118
There we go.

216
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,291
OK let's reflect a
little bit of that color

217
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,874
right down into the water here.

218
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:19,375
OK.

219
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,151
Now, let's mix up some
blue, and some brown,

220
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:29,706
and some sap green, and
you want this very dark,

221
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:30,956
it looks black.

222
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:38,227
And, we'll use the
almighty fan brush today,

223
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,490
make some little trees in the background.

224
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,586
We've used just about every brush here,

225
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,739
so just show you how you can make

226
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:49,125
some beautiful little trees with this.

227
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,464
And you just sort of let
em fall of the brush,

228
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:55,631
back and forth, shape your
tree, and lay em in there.

229
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:58,343
Maybe we'll put one a little higher,

230
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,260
that way we'll put the cloud,

231
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,112
that little cloud that's floating
in front of the mountain,

232
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:04,613
we'll put him behind the tree.

233
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:11,017
There we go.

234
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:17,883
These are fun little trees
to make, just let em happen.

235
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:24,429
OK, maybe one over here.

236
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,336
His top got bent a little bit,

237
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:36,298
maybe airplane went too
close and clipped him.

238
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:38,754
In Alaska that's not unusual,

239
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:40,533
they have some crazy
old bush pilots up there

240
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,615
that run over everything.

241
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,306
Friend of mine brought back a
12-foot tree hanging on his,

242
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:49,056
back of his airplane.

243
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:55,129
OK maybe a little baby one over here.

244
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:57,578
OK.

245
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,298
Then we'll just pull that
down into the reflections,

246
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:04,298
very gently,

247
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:07,097
like so.

248
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:12,257
Alright.

249
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,533
Now we'll take some magic white,

250
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,427
and a little bit of Van Dyke brown,

251
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:21,018
a little touch of yellow,

252
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:24,401
just to make sort of a dirt
color, sandy little color,

253
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,553
and we'll lay in some
little waterlines back here.

254
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:33,284
And maybe we'll have a
little beach comes down.

255
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,867
There, and that just
run around the corner.

256
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:46,679
OK, there you goes.

257
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:52,143
We'll take a dry brush, and
we lift this just a touch,

258
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:54,112
this is a thinner paint
so it'll move on top

259
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,778
of the other without destroying.

260
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:03,769
OK, now just some straight magic white

261
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,019
and we'll sparkle this up a little bit.

262
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:19,945
OK.

263
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,966
We'll put a few little sticks
and stems here and there.

264
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:36,486
OK, time to move forward in this picture.

265
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:39,903
We'll mix us up a little more dark color.

266
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:47,654
OK.

267
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:54,047
Let's put some paint
on the one-inch brush,

268
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:58,775
and build us another tree here.

269
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,118
Maybe we got a nice evergreen

270
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:03,201
that's growing right up through here.

271
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:07,809
There you go son.

272
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:15,978
Just let him drip out of the brush.

273
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:25,315
And we'll give him a little friend.

274
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:30,994
There,

275
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:33,953
we go, alright.

276
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:41,861
Now, let's just put
some little bushy trees

277
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:43,944
right in here, like this,

278
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:51,028
some little reflections underneath.

279
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,046
Pull those down.

280
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:00,163
OK.

281
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,312
And we'll put some
little trunk indicators,

282
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,978
just here and there.

283
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,184
Alrighty, now we can highlight that.

284
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:21,951
And we'll throw a nice
little green bush right here.

285
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,046
There's a nice little tree.

286
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:42,266
OK,

287
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,659
there.

288
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:48,492
We'll reflect those right
down into the water.

289
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:53,560
And give them a little pull.

290
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:58,582
OK, little Van Dyke brown,

291
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:03,843
and we'll put some soil in here,

292
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:09,009
and we'll just sort of
let this come around.

293
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:18,781
Then a little brown and
white, a highlighty,

294
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:23,273
make him look like stones and stuff.

295
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:29,996
Few little bushes that
travel down, there we go.

296
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:33,915
There we go.

297
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,552
OK.

298
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:43,615
And we'll put a little
waterline under here,

299
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,720
and this is still water
so it has to be flat,

300
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,655
all these lines have to be straight.

301
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:51,792
Go anywhere you wanna go with them

302
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,755
but they have to basically be straight,

303
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,994
or your water's gonna
run out of your picture,

304
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,628
you're gonna have to get a
bucket and put it under one end.

305
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:02,378
Let's put a few little
sticks here and there.

306
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,190
Alright.

307
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,097
Now, let's take some brown, and do this,

308
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:12,097
shwip, just let this go.

309
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:22,678
OK.

310
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,051
Really pushing that into the canvas,

311
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:30,738
really pushing it.

312
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:33,509
OK.

313
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,354
And we take a little
white, a little brown,

314
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,757
a little touch of blue into it here.

315
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,436
And we'll just do this, shwoo.

316
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:50,694
Turn it into some nice dirt area.

317
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,187
OK.

318
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,791
Now then,

319
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,833
let us build a tree right here.

320
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:08,511
Nice tree, there we go.

321
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,275
This is just our dark color
that we've used before,

322
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:18,442
blue and brown and a little sap green.

323
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:21,910
Maybe we need a little bush
right in here somewhere,

324
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:24,352
just to break it up.

325
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:26,269
A little bush out here.

326
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:31,747
Maybe we'll put a little bush right there.

327
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:34,652
OK.

328
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,072
Add in some little trunks.

329
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,225
Like so.

330
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:51,851
And we'll put some little
highlights on here.

331
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:05,983
OK.

332
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:08,286
(brush splashing in water)

333
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,702
(brush banging on metal)

334
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:18,852
And, there we are.

335
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:26,961
Some little things happening on this bush.

336
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,373
OK.

337
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,477
And we'll have some
little bushes over here.

338
00:23:54,657 --> 00:23:56,846
Maybe we have a little path that sort of,

339
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:58,846
just comes through here.

340
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:02,942
Just a little dark area.

341
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,378
That'll bring it down to it.

342
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:20,598
OK, let's see what we can do here.

343
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:25,075
Let's have a nice tree right here,

344
00:24:26,983 --> 00:24:30,233
heading on right up through here maybe.

345
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,047
Put his other side on,
don't want a one-sided tree.

346
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:43,797
OK, they go down through here,

347
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:47,632
just let him fall down wherever.

348
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:53,355
Maybe a little one there.

349
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,797
Give them a little highlight.

350
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:05,042
OK.

351
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:08,924
And we'll take our dark color,

352
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,380
and we'll put some leaves
on that little rascal.

353
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:30,340
There.

354
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,298
And we'll just take,

355
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:39,067
a little more color, and
we'll highlight these.

356
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:56,944
(brush splashing in water)

357
00:25:56,944 --> 00:26:00,361
(brush banging on metal)

358
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,427
Maybe we'll put a nice bright
little tree right here.

359
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,543
And a few little things down here.

360
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:19,993
This sort of gives it the indication

361
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:22,826
that the land works down that way.

362
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:25,127
OK.

363
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:31,405
Now I wanna put a few little
sticks all throughout here.

364
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:34,006
Like so.

365
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:40,308
We're just cutting through the paint here.

366
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:46,769
OK, now we'll take a dark color

367
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,731
and I've used a thin oil here,

368
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:50,494
and maybe we'll put a few
little things that are just,

369
00:26:50,494 --> 00:26:53,494
sort of, playing around out like so.

370
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:00,877
Just here and there,
wherever you'd like em.

371
00:27:00,877 --> 00:27:02,711
This is your creation.

372
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:15,404
OK, and we need to have a
old dead limb here and there.

373
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:24,295
OK maybe I'll just mix up
a dark, dark green here,

374
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:26,612
we'll just put a few little
highlights on these trees

375
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:30,487
to indicate little
lights playing on those.

376
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:31,487
There we go.

377
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:43,278
(brush splashing in water)

378
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,692
OK I think we'll sign that one,

379
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:49,275
and that one should be
just about finished.

380
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:52,534
There we are.

381
00:27:52,534 --> 00:27:55,595
I really hope you have
enjoyed this painting,

382
00:27:55,595 --> 00:27:59,168
I hope yours is complete also, if not,

383
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,645
hope you'll be with us next time.

384
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:04,213
And until we meet again, happy painting,

385
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:05,635
thank you very much.

386
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:08,969
