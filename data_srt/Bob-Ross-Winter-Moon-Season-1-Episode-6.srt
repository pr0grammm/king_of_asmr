1
00:00:01,749 --> 00:00:02,689
- Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:04,535
Today I thought we'd do a
painting that's right out of the

3
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:05,730
heart of Alaska.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,692
We're gonna start with a black
canvas, which I've already

5
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:12,000
covered with a coat of Van
Dyke brown and Prussian blue.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,367
And these colors are transparent,
so it'll still look black.

7
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,527
In this painting we want
to show the Moon in the sky

8
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:20,034
with some happy little
clouds floating around,

9
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:23,238
put some almighty mountains,
some beautiful, frost-colored

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,682
bushes, and we'll see
what happens from there.

11
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:30,397
- I'm gonna start with
a little titanium white.

12
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,509
And we'll start right up here
where we want the Moon to be.

13
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,676
And just make little x-es.

14
00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:39,070
And just start working around.

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,725
You want to start in the center
and work outwards so that

16
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:45,722
the light gets progressively
darker as it moves away

17
00:00:45,722 --> 00:00:46,890
from the Moon.

18
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:49,704
And we'll go out in this
direction so that it hits the

19
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:53,442
curvature of the Earth
and bounces back up.

20
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:55,207
Okay, there we go.

21
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,426
Already, you should be able
to see how the white paint is

22
00:00:57,426 --> 00:01:00,292
beginning to pick up the color underneath.

23
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,012
And we'll just blend this together.

24
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:03,012
There we go.

25
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:08,210
Okay, now we don't want to
let this get too bright;

26
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,146
we still want it to look like
night when we're finished,

27
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:14,527
so just work it 'round and
around and all the way out

28
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:15,609
to the edges.

29
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:20,323
And we'll do a little over in here.

30
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:26,126
Now then, we'll take the
large brush, and very gently,

31
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:30,293
we'll bring this together, just
by making little x patterns.

32
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:32,756
There we go.

33
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:43,030
Makes all the little actions in the sky.

34
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,290
And we'll come across.

35
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,426
Now, let's put the Moon in.

36
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:53,293
And we'll do that by taking a
clean brush, and we'll load it

37
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:57,548
full of white paint,
and we go right straight

38
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:59,847
into the canvas where
we want the Moon to be,

39
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,030
and we push quite hard.

40
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,754
And push the paint right into
the canvas, and just turn it.

41
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:07,587
There.

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,561
Get it in with the knife,
very carefully, we'll take off

43
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:13,394
just the excess paint.

44
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:18,925
Let me clean this ol' big brush out here.

45
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,469
There we go.

46
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,769
Now very gently, we'll
bring this together.

47
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,052
Just work it back and forth,
and create the illusion of a

48
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,719
moon setting up here in the sky.

49
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:39,983
Okay.

50
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:43,263
Now then, let's put some
happy little clouds up here.

51
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,365
And we'll use the almighty
fan brush, and we'll just use

52
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,532
this blue and brown color.

53
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,705
And...

54
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,573
Load it full of paint, and
we'll take, just using the

55
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,801
corner, and we'll put in
some happy little clouds,

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,167
just let one float right
across the Moon, here.

57
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,334
Lot of paint on the brush.

58
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:05,028
Okay.

59
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:08,679
There we go.

60
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:14,239
Now, maybe, maybe, maybe,
you can see right up here,

61
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,322
we'll put another happy little cloud.

62
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:23,862
Little sneaky cloud running
around here at night.

63
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:25,431
There we go.

64
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:27,892
And you're pushing this paint
into the canvas; really,

65
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:30,474
really work it into the canvas.

66
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,973
And maybe down here we've got
some little delicate clouds

67
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:37,990
that are just floating around,
really small, little clouds.

68
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,990
There we go.

69
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:41,540
Just lay 'em in.

70
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:47,367
Mmmkay.

71
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,046
Now, let us clean the fan brush.

72
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,505
And wiping dry.

73
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,013
And we'll take a little
bit of titanium white,

74
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:04,930
mixed with just a little
bit of the same color.

75
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:08,525
And we'll push some highlights in here.

76
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:12,414
Just take the fan brush
and just work the corners.

77
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:15,037
Just the corner of the brush.

78
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:17,639
Just push the paint right in here.

79
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,472
There.

80
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:26,091
A little light playing
across the top of this cloud.

81
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:28,389
Maybe right along here.

82
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,489
This is your world, so wherever
you want light to strike

83
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,655
this cloud, let it happen.

84
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:36,853
Okay, and let's put some
highlights right along these

85
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:38,936
little clouds right here.

86
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,876
And we're pushing quite hard with this.

87
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:46,408
Once again, we want to push
the color right into the

88
00:04:46,408 --> 00:04:48,158
material if possible.

89
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:54,430
There we go.

90
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,526
Now, in this cloud up here,
since it's above the Moon,

91
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:00,567
the light's gonna strike the bottom of it.

92
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,460
So we put the highlights
on the bottom rather than

93
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:03,377
on the top.

94
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:08,309
There.

95
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:11,250
Give me a nice little thing right out

96
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,166
through here like that.

97
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,666
Maybe a little light striking
around up in here, just a

98
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,750
little something playing.

99
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,332
Okay, now, we'll take the big brush.

100
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,190
Make sure it's dry and clean.

101
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:28,942
And we're just gonna
gently hypnotize this.

102
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,717
Just to bring it together.

103
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,680
Isn't that fantastic?

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,876
Look at that.

105
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,661
Look at all the little things
that happen in this cloud.

106
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,346
This is unplanned.

107
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:41,819
It really just happens.

108
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,572
You really can't control
what's gonna happen here.

109
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:45,151
Don't try to, don't fight it.

110
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,752
Use what happens.

111
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:47,586
Okay.

112
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:50,293
Let's make a happy little mountain now.

113
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,418
We'll take some blue and some
brown, still using the same

114
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,252
color.

115
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,887
And we'll draw in our
basic mountain shape, here.

116
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,803
Here we go.

117
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,078
Really push.

118
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:05,744
Really forcing that
paint into the material.

119
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:15,708
Maybe we'll make this one come
up a little higher so we can

120
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,458
see clouds behind it.

121
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:27,365
We use a large brush to pull
that paint down, this removes

122
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:30,742
any excess that we have
left on the canvas.

123
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:32,089
'Cause we're trying to get
all the paint off the canvas

124
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:33,839
that we possibly can.

125
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,690
Okay.

126
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:47,146
Let's just clean the brush.

127
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:52,800
Once again, we clean the brush
with odorless paint thinner.

128
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,155
Now, let's put some snow on the mountain.

129
00:06:57,156 --> 00:07:00,047
We'll take some titanium
white and just a little touch

130
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:00,880
of blue.

131
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,799
Just a little blue.

132
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:07,940
Okay.

133
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:11,704
And let's let some snow just
run right down this mountain.

134
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:12,713
Just let it break and play.

135
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:15,279
This has a very delicate touch.

136
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,696
Very light touch.

137
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,963
You're almost touching
the canvas with the knife.

138
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:26,076
Oh, here's a nice little ridge,
just let this little ridge

139
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:28,326
just play around like that.

140
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:33,390
And there we go.

141
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,396
And we'll put a little
bit of light right on

142
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:38,813
this little peak.

143
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:43,399
Let it just break and play.

144
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,522
Now we're gonna use blue and
white next to a darker value

145
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:50,621
for the shadow and we'll start
right here and let this just

146
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,884
follow right along.

147
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:53,718
Let it go.

148
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,781
Okay.

149
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:03,879
And we'll put a little
shadow behind this one.

150
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,608
There we go.

151
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:09,275
Maybe all the way over
here a little shadow.

152
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,056
Each highlight needs
its own private shadow.

153
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:22,677
And we can bring this
down a little further.

154
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:25,939
As you work on these mountains,
you begin seeing all kinds

155
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,738
of little things happening.

156
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:28,772
Use what you see.

157
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:29,939
Don't plan it.

158
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:36,771
And maybe we'll put a
little ridge right here.

159
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:38,572
Ah, there's another one,
I see him right there.

160
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,572
There he is.

161
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,081
Okay, now let's lay the bottom
of these mountains into a

162
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,812
little mist.

163
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:52,178
Clean, dry brush, and all
we're gonna do is tap.

164
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:54,721
Always following the angles
we've created in the mountain,

165
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:55,803
down like so.

166
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:57,968
Just tap.

167
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,134
Mmmkay, over here, we'll follow
these angles, and tap from

168
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:07,384
this direction.

169
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:14,190
Okay, a little bit here.

170
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,442
Then we're gonna lift upward
just enough to take out the

171
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:17,860
little tap marks.

172
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:20,508
There we go.

173
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:31,060
Mmmkay, now we're getting
a nice little misty effect

174
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:31,892
over here.

175
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,199
And we just work that right
out, and we're ready to come

176
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,269
forward.

177
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:41,033
We've created small mighty
mountains in just a few minutes

178
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:41,865
here.

179
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,733
Mmmkay.

180
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:49,253
Now, we'll take a little
more of the blue and brown,

181
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:50,956
and back to one of our golden rules,

182
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:53,254
you need dark in order to show light,

183
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:55,461
so we're gonna start by
putting some dark on here.

184
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,467
Load a lot of paint into the
brush, and we just push in

185
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,024
little bushes right out of the...

186
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:01,941
Right out of the brush.

187
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,341
Here he comes.

188
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:05,341
There he is.

189
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:09,484
Just put in some dark on him so we'll have

190
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,067
some light showing.

191
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:16,842
Alright.

192
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:21,091
Okay, now we can take a brush...

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,774
We use a little bit of magic
white and a little bit of

194
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:25,774
plain white.

195
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:30,220
Thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

196
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,844
So we're thinning the
paint just a little bit.

197
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:36,176
And we're gonna push in beautiful
little snow-covered trees,

198
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,926
way back in the distance on here.

199
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:42,430
There.

200
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,764
Look at those son of a guns.

201
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,100
There they are.

202
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,271
Just hundreds of little trees,
little bushes, all these

203
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,937
things happening way back there.

204
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,031
Okay.

205
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,197
Now we'll take the big brush
and clean it up a little bit.

206
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,088
And we have all these nice
bushes here, they need some

207
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:11,089
reflections.

208
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,499
So we'll take a clean brush
and just a little bit of white

209
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:18,413
paint on it, and we'll pull that down.

210
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:20,432
Just grab ahold and pull.

211
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:23,230
Make these nice streaks.

212
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,774
This is mixing with the color
that we have underneath,

213
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:27,691
the blue and the brown.

214
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:36,985
These lines need to be
straight down reflections.

215
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,032
What a fantastic way to make reflections.

216
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:44,717
There.

217
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:48,762
Now, we'll go across just enough
to give it a watery effect;

218
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,572
we don't want to destroy all those lines.

219
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:54,740
We just want to make it
look like it's in the water.

220
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:57,211
Mmmkay.

221
00:11:58,432 --> 00:11:59,732
Let's take...

222
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:03,018
Lay a little touch of snow along there.

223
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,013
We'll just take the knife
with a little paint.

224
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:11,157
Just put some little
snow right along there.

225
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:13,119
Ooh, better get your coat
out, this is gonna be a cold

226
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:13,951
painting.

227
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,327
I may have to go find my
old mukluks and put 'em on.

228
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:26,076
In Alaska, we have a word for
people who have came to the

229
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:29,269
great country and only been
there a short period of time:

230
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:31,351
it is called "cheechako."

231
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:35,769
And if you've been in Alaska
less than a year, you're a

232
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:36,602
cheechako.

233
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,877
So maybe you've learned a new word today.

234
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,838
And where I live it's not
unusual for it to get 60, 70

235
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,422
degrees below zero.

236
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:50,817
And we have a thing in nature
that happens, it's called

237
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:51,649
ice fog.

238
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:55,705
Normally, it has to be
about 30 below or colder.

239
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:59,594
And this ice fog coats
everything, every little branch,

240
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:03,518
with little crystals of ice
that weigh almost nothing.

241
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:06,803
But they create unbelievable beauty.

242
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:09,067
Light plays though these little
crystals and acts as little

243
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:11,400
prisms and breaks up the light.

244
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,129
You see all the fantastic
colors shining and shimmering

245
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,379
and it is really something.

246
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:20,283
Okay, here I'm just scratching
right through the paint.

247
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:23,302
Make it look like little trunks.

248
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,134
Alrighty, let's take the
almighty fan brush...

249
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:32,298
During this series we have made
trees with a two and a half

250
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:35,086
inch brush, with a one inch
brush, and a fan brush.

251
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:38,000
So, all of these brushes you
can use to create almighty

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,940
trees.

253
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,088
Today we're gonna try the fan brush.

254
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,677
Load a lot of paint into the brush.

255
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:46,010
Figure out where you'd like to
have a beautiful little tree.

256
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,995
Just touch, and then just
using the corner of the brush,

257
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:55,566
just begin building some
little limbs on here.

258
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,566
There we go.

259
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,761
And we're still using
the blue and the brown.

260
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:04,864
Come right down there.

261
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:08,928
That looks like a good place for a tree.

262
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:12,511
Gonna push the paint
right into the canvas.

263
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,351
Okay, and maybe we need one
over here that's sort of tired,

264
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:24,091
sort of leaning over a little bit.

265
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:27,509
In nature, trees grow in every direction.

266
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,881
Maybe we'll put another one right here.

267
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:34,389
These trees are so much fun to
get started on, I have a hard

268
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:35,557
time stopping.

269
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:43,315
And we'll put another one right there.

270
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:49,598
Now, as we work forward, we
want these trees to begin

271
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,766
getting much larger to show
distance in this painting.

272
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,990
In so many of the techniques
where people paint very

273
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,808
rapidly, the paintings are
very flat, very overworked,

274
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:04,993
washed-out looking.

275
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:07,826
In this technique, you
can create depth that is

276
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:08,908
unbelievable.

277
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:11,911
Distance in paintings.

278
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,242
And this is how we do it.

279
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,408
We use size, we use color.

280
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:23,290
All of these things combine
together to create the illusion

281
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,009
of distance in a painting.

282
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:25,841
Alrighty.

283
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,808
Well, let's do some more trees.

284
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:29,559
We'll put some on the
other side over here.

285
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,976
Put an almighty tree up here.

286
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:34,472
There he is.

287
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:37,916
Very dark.

288
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:45,302
Mmmkay.

289
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:47,985
Just let that tree come
right out of your fan brush.

290
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:49,541
Trees live in your fan brush, but you have

291
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,041
to scare them out.

292
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:53,326
It takes a little practice.

293
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:56,274
The first time, it's
gonna be a little touchy.

294
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,632
Next time, it gets easier.

295
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,595
Each time you do it, you learn from it.

296
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:00,677
You progress.

297
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:05,597
I've painted for 20 years,
and I'm still learning.

298
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,097
Every day I learn.

299
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:12,702
Spend time studying nature
if you wish to paint nature.

300
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:15,372
You must understand nature.

301
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,951
Talk to trees, look at the birds.

302
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:19,451
Whatever it takes.

303
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,582
Okay.

304
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:26,937
Now, then, let's do an
almighty tree, big tree.

305
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:29,437
We'll come right over in here.

306
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:33,653
Okay, here he comes.

307
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:38,526
Big ol' tree.

308
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:43,538
You got your coat out yet?

309
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:46,206
You may need it here any second.

310
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:52,165
In the paintings like this, on
the black canvas, you can do

311
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,614
a multitude of things
with this, multitude.

312
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,086
You can use all different colors.

313
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,920
All you're looking for is
a color that's transparent,

314
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,964
so that the black shows through.

315
00:17:01,964 --> 00:17:04,713
Use this black to your advantage.

316
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:08,946
We'll have another tree right there.

317
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:11,183
There we go.

318
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:17,788
There are a lot of people we
have taught to do these black

319
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:21,955
canvas who are absolutely
making a living out of it now.

320
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,145
And we have literally taught
thousands and thousands

321
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:29,979
of people to be almighty painters.

322
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:35,285
To create things of beauty
they never dreamed possible.

323
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:36,957
And you can do it too.

324
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,124
You can do it.

325
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,447
Just jump right in here and
paint along with us, we'll

326
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:45,895
teach you how to do it;
we'll make a happy painter

327
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:47,229
out of you also.

328
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,375
Okay, I think that's
enough trees for right now.

329
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,542
Let's take a little bit of
white and blue mixed together,

330
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:59,805
looking for a dark blue, here.

331
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:03,009
And let's go right into this
area here, and let's put some,

332
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:06,991
let's put some happy little
bushes and trees back in here.

333
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:09,658
All this is is the shadow color.

334
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:16,929
We put the shadow in first,
and then we'll highlight it.

335
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,776
And, while we've got the shadow
here, let's put some right

336
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:20,784
into the water.

337
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:24,701
We can just reflect some
of this right in here.

338
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,610
Okay, now, let's...

339
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,254
Oh, let's have some bushes
over in this side also.

340
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:35,123
Just start bringing
this painting together.

341
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,224
Now at home you have unlimited time.

342
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:40,381
You can sit and come up with
all kinds of fantastic things

343
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:41,613
to do in this.

344
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:43,260
You can put tremendous detail.

345
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,337
Here we are limited on time,
so we're trying to give you

346
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:49,042
ideas, we're not trying to just
give you something to copy,

347
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:53,384
we're trying to give you an
idea, to teach you a technique,

348
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:57,669
so that you can use this and
make unbelievable things.

349
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,640
Back into the magic white
and the titanium white.

350
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,669
And we'll make some
happy little bushes here.

351
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:09,752
Look how that color stands
out against the black.

352
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,620
There we go.

353
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:17,080
And as you work more and more
in this, you'll know just by

354
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,286
pulling the brush through,
the correct consistency of the

355
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:22,870
paint, if it's too
thin, if it's too thick.

356
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:25,429
It's only a matter of time
where you can pull the brush

357
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,249
through that paint and
almost tell what brand it is.

358
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:31,303
Now we'll just come across,
and we'll turn this into

359
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,720
beautiful little reflections.

360
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:38,419
And while we've got the brush
loaded here, we'll just, let's

361
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,464
do this one right here.

362
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:41,630
Big tree here.

363
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:45,121
There we go.

364
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,961
Little more of the magic white.

365
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:53,350
And we'll come right down here
and put a happy little bush.

366
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:55,650
Now, let's reflect these right
into the water; just let 'em

367
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,483
reflect.

368
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:01,687
Okay.

369
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:03,353
Clean off the brush.

370
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:13,377
That's the most fun of
painting is beating your brush.

371
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:14,817
It's a good way to get rid
of all your anxieties and

372
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:15,817
hostilities.

373
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:19,485
Look at those reflections.

374
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,901
But it's a very gentle touch.

375
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,022
And now we'll take a
little bit of white paint,

376
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:27,214
just put some snow in
here for all these things

377
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:28,048
to sit on.

378
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:30,965
There we go.

379
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:40,519
Okay, a little bit of dark
paint; we'll put some trunks in.

380
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,436
Some stems.

381
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:44,144
There we are.

382
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,628
This sort of gives the
tree body, gives it shape.

383
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,927
And it also shows distance in a painting.

384
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:57,261
Use these to your advantage.

385
00:20:58,781 --> 00:20:59,615
Okay.

386
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:04,540
Take a little magic white, make
us a water line under here.

387
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,758
Just use a thin paint
to make your water line.

388
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,841
It'll flow off the knife.

389
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,067
Alrighty.

390
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,635
There we go.

391
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:27,552
Nice little water line.

392
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:32,009
Mmmkay, let's put some happy
little bushes over here on the

393
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:33,259
other side now.

394
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,013
And we'll start right here.

395
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:38,513
A nice one, there.

396
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,355
Leave a lot of these dark areas showing.

397
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:43,910
Be careful that you
don't cover 'em all up.

398
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,160
Your painting will get very, very flat.

399
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,992
Look at all the snow on those.

400
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:56,725
Okay.

401
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:01,777
And work 'em in layers so
you have distance in here.

402
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,611
Do one bush at a time.

403
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:08,695
Okay, we'll put a few
little sticks in here.

404
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:15,881
Mmmkay.

405
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:23,012
Now then, let's lay a
little snow into this side.

406
00:22:23,012 --> 00:22:24,615
Just using straight titanium white.

407
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:26,217
This is very firm.

408
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:30,141
And let it break, so you
have shadows showing through.

409
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:34,224
Just like when we do the
mountains, let it break.

410
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:37,977
Okay.

411
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:38,978
There we go.

412
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:42,744
And we lay the snow in like so.

413
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:54,766
And maybe, maybe there was
an old trapper that lived out

414
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:58,121
here and one day he went
to check his beaver traps

415
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:00,989
and maybe he fell into the
river here and drowned, but his

416
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:05,006
old cabin's still here, so
let's draw an old cabin in.

417
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:07,258
I suggest you scrape it with
a knife first, scrape out the

418
00:23:07,258 --> 00:23:08,778
basic shape.

419
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:11,403
It gets rid of the thin,
loose paint underneath.

420
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:14,107
It's also a good way to lay
out your general shape of your

421
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:17,162
cabin, get your perspective right.

422
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,162
There we go.

423
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:23,558
Just very basic shape,
that's all we're looking for.

424
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:26,508
Big thing is to get rid
of all that loose paint.

425
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:30,501
And we'll take some Van Dyke
brown and we'll do the far eave

426
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:31,751
out here first.

427
00:23:35,365 --> 00:23:36,199
There.

428
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,093
There we go.

429
00:23:41,693 --> 00:23:45,860
Now, we'll take some titanium
white, and let's lay some

430
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,299
snow on the roof.

431
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:52,374
Over here.

432
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:53,814
There.

433
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:57,099
Let's bring this all together.

434
00:23:57,098 --> 00:23:58,770
There we go.

435
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,779
Now, we need to have a
little snow on the other side

436
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,915
of the roof, so we'll just take
a little white on the knife

437
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:04,749
and lay it in like so.

438
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:10,067
Little more brown, and
we'll begin putting all this

439
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:10,901
together.

440
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:17,963
There we go.

441
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,420
A fantastic way to make a little cabin.

442
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:29,047
There.

443
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,221
And if you want to make it
look even older, you can take

444
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,972
just a little bit of the white
paint and let it just sort of

445
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,556
bounce along here, very gently.

446
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:41,298
Just let it touch and bounce.

447
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:43,840
Little more dark to
create the shadows on top.

448
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,001
Ooh, look at that.

449
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:47,532
Look how old that wood looks.

450
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:50,319
It's a super way to make old
buildings and stuff if you ever

451
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,569
want to try it.

452
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,625
Okay, I think we need a door in here now.

453
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,634
Somebody might need to come
along and stay in this old

454
00:24:57,634 --> 00:25:00,095
cabin, so he's got to
have a way to get in.

455
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:01,095
There we go.

456
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:06,922
And we'll take in some highlights
around the door, just by

457
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,255
using the knife.

458
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:13,037
And probably when this
old trapper lived here,

459
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:16,555
he's just like all the rest
of us, he ran out of room,

460
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:18,564
so he probably built him
a little shed out here.

461
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,490
So we'll just build us a little shed.

462
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,648
Just bring a little
snow for the roof first.

463
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,648
There we go.

464
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,774
Just like so.

465
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:32,159
Take a little bit of dark paint...

466
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:34,933
A little brown...

467
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:40,388
And we need a wall over here,
so we'll just drop it in.

468
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:43,836
There.

469
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:50,107
Okay, let's make this an old slab cabin.

470
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:52,696
So we'll just cut in some
slabs here with the point

471
00:25:52,696 --> 00:25:53,779
of the knife.

472
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,932
There we go.

473
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:02,113
And we can take a little
white and clean this all up.

474
00:26:02,113 --> 00:26:04,411
Right now, you should begin
having a painting that's

475
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:09,020
beginning to take shape,
beginning to look well.

476
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,437
Should be very happy with it.

477
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:16,078
And I think we've said it
before, but painting should do

478
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:19,933
one thing for you: it should
create happiness in your heart.

479
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:22,017
It should make you happy.

480
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:26,446
Let's take and put a
little bush right here.

481
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:29,616
Just let a few of these run down.

482
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:33,355
Maybe, maybe a little bush
right here to sort of push this

483
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:36,233
cabin back into the painting.

484
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:38,150
Right along that cabin.

485
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,818
Okay, we need some highlights
on this little bush.

486
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:42,818
There we go.

487
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:48,145
Okay, and we'll cut a few
little sticks here and there.

488
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:51,454
We're just cutting right
through the light paint,

489
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:53,954
letting the dark show through.

490
00:26:58,758 --> 00:26:59,591
Alright.

491
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:08,393
This painting's beginning
to get close to being done.

492
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:14,744
Let's take the fan brush here,
and normally, I would leave

493
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:16,288
these trees very dark.

494
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:20,573
I want to take a little bit
of blue and just tap a little

495
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:23,649
so you can see them a
little better at home.

496
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:25,204
Just to give you an idea.

497
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:28,327
Normally I leave them very,
very dark, so they really give

498
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:30,744
the impression of night time.

499
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:32,505
Like so.

500
00:27:34,698 --> 00:27:35,882
Okay, just here and there.

501
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:38,298
Just a few little highlights.

502
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,758
There.

503
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:42,841
And just a few over here.

504
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:46,688
Like so.

505
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
There we go.

506
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:55,372
Alrighty.

507
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:57,697
I think we're gonna sign
this painting, and call it

508
00:27:57,696 --> 00:27:58,973
finished.

509
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:01,473
Take a little of the thin oil.

510
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,221
And let's sign it right here.

511
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:06,660
I hope you've enjoyed this painting.

512
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,250
It is a great deal of fun.

513
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,245
We certainly have enjoyed
being with you today.

514
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,742
And I hope you've painted along
with us, and you also have

515
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:15,507
an almighty painting.

516
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:17,353
All you need is the dream
in your heart and the desire

517
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:18,990
to put it on canvas.

518
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,614
Until next time, we
wish you happy painting.

519
00:28:21,614 --> 00:28:23,280
Thank you very much.

520
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,832
(happy little country music)
