1
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:02,916
- Hello, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:04,748
I thought today, we'd
do an almighty picture

3
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:06,898
that had some huge mountains in it

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,522
and maybe today, we'll
also work a little bit on

5
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:11,634
putting some clouds floating
in front of the mountains.

6
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:14,308
This is always something
that's very difficult to do,

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:16,463
so I'll try to show ya how to do that

8
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:18,667
and I hope you have a canvas
set up on your almighty easel

9
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,085
and cool drink in hand and let's go here.

10
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,649
I'm gonna start with a little
bit of alizarin crimson

11
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,993
and a touch of prussian blue

12
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:30,992
and maybe we'll just make
a sky that's sort of a

13
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:34,698
lavender type and sorta taste it, test it.

14
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:36,335
There we go.

15
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,671
I already have magic white on the canvas.

16
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:42,032
So, we're just literally mixing paint

17
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,861
right here on the canvas.

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,777
(calm jazzy music)

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,387
And we'll just bring this
down to about like so.

20
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:53,387
There we go.

21
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:58,216
Now, go into just a little prussian blue

22
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:03,780
and we'll lay this right
in like so, there we go.

23
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:10,051
Okay.

24
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:11,791
And while we have the
old brush dirty here,

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,932
I'll take a little phthalo
green in prussian blue

26
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:17,682
and we'll lay in some water here.

27
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:28,292
And already, we have a masterpiece for

28
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:31,042
a museum of modern art somewhere.

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,180
Okay, now we'll clean the old brush.

30
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:45,203
Be sure it's good and dry.

31
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:47,221
Then, this is just a clean, dry brush

32
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:51,388
and we're just gonna bring
these two colors together here.

33
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:55,510
Okay.

34
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:00,754
Just do you have a nice blending.

35
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,298
You don't wanna be able
to tell where one stops

36
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,382
and the other one starts.

37
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:10,800
And we'll hypnotize it
and sort of blend it out.

38
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:17,425
Okay, now let's take the fan brush,

39
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:21,146
a little bit of titanium white

40
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:23,912
mixed with a touch of permanent red

41
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:26,354
just to give it a little pinkish hue.

42
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,851
We don't wanna set these clouds on fire.

43
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,050
All we wanna do is give
it just a little hue here,

44
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,917
just a little pinkish hue

45
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:37,322
and we'll push us in some
nice little clouds here.

46
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,990
We're pushing very hard
just to push the value

47
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,823
right into the canvas.

48
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:49,237
And maybe we'll put little
cloud floating around

49
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,155
right here.

50
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:58,618
Okay.

51
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:03,224
We'll take and gently, gently, gently

52
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,890
blend that together.

53
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:08,098
Very light, delicate touch.

54
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:10,919
Don't overwork these clouds.

55
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,252
They're very, very easy to overwork 'em.

56
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:17,931
Then we'll hypnotize 'em.

57
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,661
Okay, let's build us an almighty mountain.

58
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,020
We'll take a little bit of blue

59
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,853
and some brown, touch of alizarin.

60
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,027
And a little bit of white.

61
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:37,252
There we go.

62
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:38,894
And mix your color marbley.

63
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,395
Don't mix it dead.

64
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:45,085
Let's start way up here.

65
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:47,418
Put us an almighty mountain.

66
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:52,739
Maybe there's a nice
little peak over here.

67
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,323
Let this drop down.

68
00:03:56,312 --> 00:04:00,965
We're really pushing this
paint into the canvas.

69
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:05,133
Maybe we'll have another
little peak over in here.

70
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:09,864
And we'll take off all the excess paint.

71
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:17,451
Then we'll take the big
brush and pull it down

72
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,559
just to make sure we've
got all the paint off of it

73
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,013
that can come off.

74
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,836
All we wanna leave is
the value in the canvas,

75
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:23,670
the color.

76
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:35,074
Now, we'll start with a
little bit of titanium white

77
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,464
and I'm gonna mix a little
bit of brown and blue with it

78
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:39,214
just to gray it down.

79
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,870
Just a little bit.

80
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:51,315
We can start putting
some highlights on this

81
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:52,814
almighty mountain.

82
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:59,344
Maybe we'll have a little peak rolling

83
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,428
right down through there.

84
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:11,956
Maybe a little light's
hitting right up here.

85
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,689
And for shadow color,
we'll take a little bit of

86
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,689
blue and brown and white

87
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,581
mixed with a little darker value.

88
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:29,664
And we'll just lay us some
shadows right in here.

89
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:37,292
And each little highlight
needs it's own private shadow.

90
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:53,704
Maybe we'll add another little peak here.

91
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:55,019
This is your mountain, so you can add

92
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,936
what you want to on it.

93
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:07,583
Now let's diffuse the bottom of it

94
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,106
and here, we're just gently tapping.

95
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:12,939
Don't wanna destroy, just diffuse.

96
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,028
And then we'll pull just to take out

97
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,778
the little tap marks.

98
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:27,689
Now, we'll lay some clouds
on top of the mountain.

99
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,278
And I've added a little bit of magic white

100
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:33,918
with my paint just to make
it a little bit thinner.

101
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,891
You remember our golden rule here.

102
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:38,045
Thin paint'll stick to a thick paint.

103
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:39,959
So, maybe we'll have a little cloud here

104
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,542
that just floats right
across the mountain.

105
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,392
Okay.

106
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,686
Maybe right up here, there's one too.

107
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,519
Seems like I remember one up here.

108
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:12,084
Now, very carefully, we'll blend this in.

109
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,481
Super light touch here.

110
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:22,012
Okay, let's take

111
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:27,848
and let's work on this peak now.

112
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,682
Let's let him travel down and

113
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:34,348
just come right down
in the foreground here.

114
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:48,007
Give him a few little shadows

115
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:50,840
so he stands out as an individual.

116
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,975
And maybe a few little shadows in here.

117
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:07,930
Okay and once again, we'll diffuse this

118
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,430
just to lay some mist in here.

119
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,875
And then, maybe another
little layer of clouds

120
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,730
and we'll add a little more magic white

121
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,647
to keep the paint thin.

122
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:35,821
And maybe this one just drops
right out of the sky here.

123
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,451
And plays around the bottom.

124
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,759
There we go.

125
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,292
Just nice, soft little clouds.

126
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,977
Okay, this is a very, very delicate touch.

127
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:12,795
There.

128
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,615
And maybe we'll just take and

129
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:24,995
maybe there's another
little stone right in here.

130
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,245
Travels around.

131
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,115
Just to show ya how to continually
bring things forward here

132
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:34,225
and we need this to be a little darker

133
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:36,725
than the background back here.

134
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:46,098
And we'll lay some
highlights right on here.

135
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:49,383
Let that paint break.

136
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:53,323
Let it break so you have all
these little holes in it.

137
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:56,155
Let some of the dark show through.

138
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:15,482
There we go.

139
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,985
And maybe just a few little clouds,

140
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:25,567
little misty areas
floating around in here.

141
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,309
This creates a tremendous
illusion of distance,

142
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,559
makes things far, far away.

143
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:40,444
Now, we'll just hypnotize
this a little touch.

144
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:47,874
And it's vitally important,
when you're doing this at home,

145
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:50,498
that you use a paint
that's very, very firm.

146
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:51,997
Otherwise, you have nothing that's thinner

147
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:54,107
to go over the top of it, so be sure

148
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,190
to use a very firm paint.

149
00:10:57,763 --> 00:11:00,249
Okay, let's mix us up a little color.

150
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,749
We'll add a little

151
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,763
sap green, little more blue in here.

152
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:11,215
Maybe just a touch more alizarin.

153
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:12,811
There we go, nice color.

154
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:17,401
And don't mix it dead,
remember not to mix it dead.

155
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,092
And we'll take this old big brush

156
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:23,259
and let's put us some little
foothills right in here.

157
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,256
Don't let the size of this
big brush scare you away.

158
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,005
Use it, it does fantastic things.

159
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:37,401
Now I'm gonna give it
just a little upward sweep

160
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,664
to make it look like little trees

161
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,440
way, way back in the distance.

162
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:42,441
There we go.

163
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:50,238
Then we'll tap a little bit here

164
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:52,066
just to lay some mist in between these.

165
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:54,649
We'll have two of 'em, I think.

166
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:00,456
Now we'll add a little more of the brown

167
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:02,057
and a little more of the blue just to

168
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:03,745
darken it up a little bit here.

169
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:04,725
All the same colors.

170
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,536
Blue, brown, a little alizarin, sap,

171
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:08,943
just to make it a little bit darker

172
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:12,223
so it'll look like it's in front.

173
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:13,539
There we go.

174
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:15,270
We'll lay another little ridge of

175
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,187
foothills right down through there.

176
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:31,120
We'll give those a little upward swirl.

177
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,870
Just barely, barely
touching the canvas here.

178
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:40,331
Okay.

179
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:52,863
Now we can start coming forward.

180
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,582
And we'll take a little bit of sap green

181
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:57,880
mixed with a little bit of alizarin

182
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,213
and then I'll mix that into some yellow.

183
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,331
Makes sort of a dirty green color

184
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:06,831
and we'll start putting some little trees

185
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:08,748
that are way back here.

186
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:13,114
Load a lot of paint in your brush

187
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:14,864
and just push upward.

188
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,253
There, all these little things happening

189
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:24,336
way back in the distance.

190
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,665
And maybe just a little
touch of yellow right here.

191
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,244
Just let this blend right
with the color that you had.

192
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:36,076
Let it go.

193
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:47,144
Now I'm gonna take and
pull just the edges down.

194
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,876
Don't overwork this
because you're working with

195
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:50,794
yellow into the blue water and it'll just

196
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:52,692
turn it bright green on ya.

197
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:57,246
Just pull it down,
hypnotize it a little bit,

198
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:58,829
and leave it alone.

199
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:04,961
Now we can put a few little
sticks here and there.

200
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:09,291
Just cutting through the
paint is all we're doing.

201
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,458
Make it look like little trunks
way back in the distance.

202
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:28,148
We'll take just a little
touch of phthalo green

203
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:30,065
mixed with a cad yellow

204
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,286
and a little bit of permanent red.

205
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:38,411
And we'll put some
highlights on these trees.

206
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,812
Just where the sun's running through there

207
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,145
and sparkling on top of 'em.

208
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:51,033
There we go.

209
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:56,873
Now, some straight vandyke brown

210
00:14:56,873 --> 00:15:01,140
and we just lay us a
little, little bit of dirt

211
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,557
and gravel and stuff in here.

212
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,449
This isn't straight magic
white and we're just gonna

213
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,088
lay it right underneath here

214
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:22,089
just to give us a little water line.

215
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,358
And when you're doing this at home,

216
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,373
you'll have a lot more
time than we do here.

217
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,445
You can take your time
and put in all the little

218
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:33,195
fantastic details that
you want to back here.

219
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:43,350
Okay.

220
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:47,347
Let's begin moving this
in a little bit closer.

221
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,180
Using the same colors.

222
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:54,136
We'll just start coming forward.

223
00:15:56,668 --> 00:16:00,751
Maybe we need a nice tall
little tree right here.

224
00:16:15,663 --> 00:16:19,706
Let's put us a little bush over here also.

225
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:21,873
Can't leave this side out.

226
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:32,586
There we go.

227
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,004
Just lay that in.

228
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:44,442
Ya know, we'd love to hear from ya

229
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:46,922
and love to hear how
you're doing with all this

230
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,922
and if it's helping you.

231
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,676
We'd like to know what you
wanna see on these shows.

232
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,975
If you wanna see different things painted,

233
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,596
different techniques.

234
00:16:57,596 --> 00:17:00,127
We'd also maybe like to, in the future,

235
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:01,437
bring some of the better instructors

236
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,427
that we have met across the United States

237
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:06,847
and maybe we'll have them demonstrate some

238
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:10,263
unbelievable techniques that can be done.

239
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:14,847
But we need to know what
you want, so let us know.

240
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:18,147
Now, let's take a little bit of the brown

241
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:22,314
and we'll just lay some
little trunks here and there.

242
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:30,451
Maybe we'll give this
little bush one here.

243
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,576
And we'll put some highlights on that.

244
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:48,236
Still fascinates me how this works

245
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,653
and how beautifully it works.

246
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:02,024
Okay, let's see, maybe we need a little,

247
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:03,440
there, that's it.

248
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,002
And down in here, we
need some little bushes

249
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:19,382
that are hiding underneath
this bigger one.

250
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:23,548
And we'll put some little
reflections in the water.

251
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,173
There we go.

252
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:33,120
Little red fireball there.

253
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:37,791
Okay.

254
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:40,921
Little touch more of the magic white

255
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,890
just to thin it down a touch.

256
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,109
Let's go over here

257
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:49,275
and we'll put some nice little
highlights on this tree.

258
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:01,872
There we go.

259
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:08,358
Leave a lot of these dark areas in here.

260
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:12,996
They create the shadows that
you need so desperately.

261
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:14,689
And we'll put a little color right here

262
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,022
for reflections.

263
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,326
Then we can lay a little
color right on top

264
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:28,576
to give us nice, beautiful reflections.

265
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,131
Right there.

266
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:40,069
Okay.

267
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:45,985
Now, let's take a little
more of the straight brown

268
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:56,392
and a little bit right along here

269
00:19:56,392 --> 00:20:01,174
and we'll just draw in
some little bit of shore,

270
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:02,591
little bank here.

271
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,749
Lay a little highlight on top of that.

272
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,836
Touch here.

273
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,719
Okay, let's see what we got going here.

274
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,661
Looks like we have a
lot of space up in here

275
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,697
that we really need to do something with.

276
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,807
So, let's do this.

277
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:36,974
This is alizarin, crimson,
little bit of sap green.

278
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,153
Now we've gotta do something up here

279
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:45,737
'cause we've thrown
all this color in here.

280
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,275
There we go.

281
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:53,179
Maybe we'll put a little
bit right out here too.

282
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,596
Looks so good, we might as well not stop.

283
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:01,709
We'll take a little bit of vandyke brown

284
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,410
and let's do us an almighty tree coming

285
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,243
right up through here.

286
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:08,237
There he is.

287
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:18,254
And you're just sort of
pulling this sideways

288
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:20,035
to lay the paint right on the canvas,

289
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:22,202
let it pull off the knife.

290
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:31,143
And maybe we can give him
some little arms out here.

291
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
There we go.

292
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,863
And there's another one.

293
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,708
And maybe this is a
separate little entity,

294
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,866
little tree by itself growing down here.

295
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:49,950
Just a little sprout off the big one.

296
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,437
Now we can put some
highlights on these leaves.

297
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,521
And just let it touch.

298
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:08,188
Bend the bristles just
the least little bit.

299
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:13,363
There we go.

300
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,282
Few over here.

301
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:24,002
Isn't that fantastic that you can create

302
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:26,252
an almighty tree that fast?

303
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:35,166
We'll put a little highlight
here in this one too.

304
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,833
Don't want him to feel left out.

305
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,904
Let's put a little something over here

306
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,238
to give this a feel of bark.

307
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,385
Just here and there.

308
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:53,983
There we go.

309
00:22:56,219 --> 00:22:57,720
Let's see.

310
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,053
Maybe over here.

311
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:03,153
Let's be brave.

312
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:07,320
Let's put an old, dead
tree right up through here.

313
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:10,611
And this old tree is tired.

314
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:13,002
He's just about to fall down.

315
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,168
Not too much left for him.

316
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,778
We'll give him a little tired arm.

317
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:34,224
There we go.

318
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:37,556
And here and there.

319
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:42,077
Just let these happen.

320
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:49,214
Good.

321
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:54,707
Maybe another little stick right there.

322
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:56,797
Alrighty.

323
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:58,343
Now, maybe we'll do
something a little touch

324
00:23:58,343 --> 00:23:59,233
different here.

325
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,232
I'm gonna take a little
bit of the permanent red

326
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:07,379
and sorta highlight this old tree,

327
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:11,004
just run it down through there.

328
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:16,452
There we go.

329
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:28,108
And if we wanted to make
a few more little branches

330
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:30,500
on this tree, we can take

331
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,035
a little bit of the thin oil

332
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:35,613
and thin this down and we can lay

333
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:40,286
just a few more little
branches here and there.

334
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:42,702
Just a few that's hangin' on.

335
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:46,878
Most of 'em have already fallen off.

336
00:24:55,922 --> 00:24:57,557
Okay, now we'll put something here

337
00:24:57,557 --> 00:24:59,240
to cover up his foot, so it pushes him

338
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,230
back down in there.

339
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,634
Let's do the same thing over here.

340
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:05,011
Need to push him back into the picture.

341
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:07,120
And maybe we can take a little more of the

342
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:09,619
sap green and alizarin combination

343
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:11,118
and let's do this.

344
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:15,570
Maybe we'll just project this right on out

345
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:16,819
toward us here.

346
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:26,561
Give him some highlights.

347
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:38,355
Okay, there we go.

348
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:51,615
By now, if you're
painting at home with us,

349
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:54,603
you should begin having
a picture that's getting

350
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:57,228
close to being completed.

351
00:25:57,228 --> 00:26:01,495
Should have listed your
spirits up very high

352
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:04,077
and ready to go to another one.

353
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,099
We just put a little
magic white under here

354
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:13,332
to give us a little water line

355
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,166
like so.

356
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,153
And let's put a few little
sticks here and there.

357
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:31,538
Okay, there.

358
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:41,975
Now, this is a most interesting picture

359
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,660
because of the mountains

360
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,490
and once again, the biggest thing

361
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,067
we'd like for you to learn from this one

362
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,414
is the laying of clouds
in front of mountains

363
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:52,244
and how to make these mountains be pushed

364
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,411
far, far away.

365
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,526
Okay, these little sticks
show all different planes.

366
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:06,610
They create the illusion of distance.

367
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:15,201
Okay, I think this one's just about ready

368
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:17,126
for a signature.

369
00:27:17,126 --> 00:27:20,644
So, we'll take a little of the thin oil,

370
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:25,375
mix it up real good, make
it almost like water here.

371
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:30,307
And we'll just lay a little
signature right there.

372
00:27:30,307 --> 00:27:33,808
And I'm very fortunate 'cause
I have a short name so,

373
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:36,475
only takes me a second to do so.

374
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:46,377
And I think we'll call that one finished.

375
00:27:46,377 --> 00:27:47,776
If we mess with it any
more, we're gonna start

376
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:49,609
fiddling it to death.

377
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:52,326
Do your picture, get
your dream out on canvas

378
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:53,159
and leave it alone.

379
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,998
Don't fiddle with it all day.

380
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:56,592
In the time you spend fiddling,

381
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,608
you could do another picture.

382
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:01,230
So, thank you very, very
much for watching us.

383
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,233
We hope to see you again and until then,

384
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,984
happy painting.

385
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,401
(calm piano)
