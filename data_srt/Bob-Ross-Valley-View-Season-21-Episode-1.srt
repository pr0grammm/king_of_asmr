1
00:00:00,651 --> 00:00:05,601
(bright music)

2
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,862
- Hello, I'm Bob Ross and
I'd like to welcome you

3
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:35,463
to the 21st Joy of Painting series.

4
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:37,003
If this is your first time with us,

5
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,463
let me extend a personal invitation

6
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:40,082
for you to drag out your
little paint brushes

7
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,022
and some paints and paint
along with us each show.

8
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:44,923
Or just drag up the old easy chair

9
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,445
and enjoy a relaxing half hour

10
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,605
as we play some of nature's
masterpieces on canvas.

11
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:51,564
And for those of you've
been with us for a while,

12
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:53,625
thank you very, very
much for inviting us back

13
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,805
for another series of painting shows.

14
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,724
Tell you what, let's get right to it.

15
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,245
Let's start today and have
'em run all the colors

16
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:01,945
across the screen that you
need to paint along with me.

17
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:03,505
And while they're doing
that, come on up here

18
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,644
and let me show you
what I've already done.

19
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:08,265
Have my standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas,

20
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:10,584
but you use any size
that's convenient for you.

21
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,625
We just use this

22
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,006
because it sorta fits
the television screen.

23
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,766
The bottom of it I have
covered with a little bit

24
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,446
of black gesso.

25
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,006
And you can put it on with a sponge

26
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,186
or foam brush or just paper towel.

27
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:23,487
It doesn't matter, anything to cover it

28
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:25,387
and then let that dry.

29
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,387
Then we've applied some transparent color

30
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,966
down here on the bottom of this.

31
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:30,587
And today I've used a little sap green

32
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:32,746
and Van Dyke brown mixed together.

33
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:33,887
And it's still wet.

34
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,346
The black gesso has dried

35
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:39,126
but the transparent color
on top here is still wet.

36
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:40,426
Okay, and then the top we've just covered

37
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:41,667
with a little bit of liquid white,

38
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,406
and it just makes the canvas
nice and wet and slick

39
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:47,307
and it allows us to actually
blend color on the canvas

40
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,847
rather than working ourself
to death on the palette.

41
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:51,266
So I tell you what, let's just take off

42
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,786
and have some fun today.

43
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:54,859
Let's start with this
little two inch brush here

44
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:57,000
and we'll go right into a small amount

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,739
of the phthalo blue.

46
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,219
And all we do is just
pull a little bit out

47
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,159
and then tap it into the bristles.

48
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,979
By tapping, and turn the
brush over, tap both sides.

49
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,980
See that assures a nice
even distribution of color

50
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,340
all the way through the bristles

51
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,820
and that's what we're looking for.

52
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,620
And it's easy to add more color,

53
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,520
but it's a son of a gun to take it away.

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
So start with a little bit of color.

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,200
You can always add more if you need it.

56
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,159
We'll go right up to the top of the canvas

57
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,219
and we'll start, we'll
just do some little Xs,

58
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,919
little criss cross strokes.

59
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,419
And we'll work all the way across the top.

60
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:33,099
Now the color is continually
mixing with the liquid white.

61
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:36,460
And it creates all those
beautiful variations that we want.

62
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,879
Let me put a little more
color on the brush here.

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,240
There we go.

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,181
But start at the top and work down.

65
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,441
And that way our sky will
get progressively lighter

66
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:46,902
toward the horizon.

67
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:49,582
And that's exactly what we're looking for.

68
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:51,383
In a landscape you want things

69
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:53,663
to get lighter toward the horizon

70
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:57,403
and darker as they come
away from the horizon.

71
00:02:57,402 --> 00:02:59,423
So by using the liquid white

72
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:01,402
and allowing the color to blend,

73
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:04,282
that effect happens automatically.

74
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:06,122
You really don't have to worry about it,

75
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:07,822
it just happens.

76
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:10,424
And that truly is the joy of painting.

77
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:14,114
There, we'll just work this right on down.

78
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,944
I thought today we'd start this series

79
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:19,443
with just a very basic little painting.

80
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:20,724
And if you've painted with us before

81
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:22,543
this'll be an easy one for ya.

82
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:26,884
If this is your first time,
then you can see one of the ways

83
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:30,093
this fantastic technique works.

84
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:32,804
Okay, now we just take and very gently

85
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,743
go across the entire sky.

86
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:36,663
This just removes the brush strokes.

87
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:38,113
That's all we're doing.

88
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:41,264
Okay, and that simple.

89
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,306
We have a happy little sky.

90
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,566
And that's all you have to do

91
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,728
to make a very, very basic little sky.

92
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,588
Now let's build us a little mountain.

93
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:49,907
I like the mountains.

94
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:53,087
We'll take some black,
little Prussian blue,

95
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:56,828
some alizarin crimson and
we just mix those together.

96
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:58,668
I'd even put a little
Van Dyke brown in there,

97
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,609
just to dull it down some.

98
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,569
Pull the color out as
flat as you can get it

99
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:04,649
and go straight down with the knife,

100
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:07,209
cut across so you have
a little roll of paint.

101
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,509
And that little roll of paint should live

102
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,428
right on the edge of your knife,

103
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:12,188
right on the edge of the blade.

104
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:15,049
Now then we have to make
our first major decision

105
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:15,989
in this painting.

106
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,689
Where does our mountain live?

107
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:22,269
I think in my world it's
gonna live maybe right there.

108
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:24,639
It is now anyway.

109
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,069
All we're doing here is
just pushing that color

110
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:30,990
right into the fabric,
right into the canvas.

111
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,591
And this is pre-stretched canvas,

112
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,310
we do not recommend the canvas boards

113
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,742
'cause they have the tendency
to absorb the liquid white

114
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,871
and you end up with a dry
surface almost immediately.

115
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,370
Maybe, maybe here, yeah, right there.

116
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,210
We'll have another little bump there.

117
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,740
Just wherever you want 'em.

118
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,170
And painting is a very individual,

119
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,790
everybody will see nature
through different eyes

120
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,471
and everybody has their own idea

121
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:02,091
of what a mountain should
look like, or a tree.

122
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:05,271
All we wanna do here is show
you how to make these effects.

123
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,471
What you paint is totally up to you.

124
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:11,291
We just wanna show you how to paint.

125
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,812
Just to get you, just to get you started.

126
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:19,332
There, now using a big brush
and very firm pressure,

127
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,333
I wanna pull this down.

128
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,813
The only thing we're
worried about right now

129
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:24,072
is this nice outside edge.

130
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:26,432
We could care less
what's happening in here.

131
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:27,733
But once again,

132
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:30,153
because we have the liquid
white on the canvas,

133
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:33,853
the color is blending with
that and as you can plainly see

134
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:35,393
automatically as it goes down

135
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:38,512
it gets lighter and lighter in value.

136
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,852
And once again, that
will happen automatically

137
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:42,872
when you have the liquid
white on the canvas.

138
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,552
And it's just an oil base,

139
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,504
white paint that allows
you to do all this.

140
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:50,894
You can just blend it right on down

141
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:52,114
and already that mountain looks like

142
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:54,734
it's almost sitting out there in the mist.

143
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,574
I tell you what, let's wash the old brush.

144
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:58,795
That's the fun part of this.

145
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,735
That's the fun part.

146
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,575
Shake off the excess and just,

147
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,357
(chuckling) just beat the devil out of it.

148
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:10,857
As I say, that's the
part that's the most fun.

149
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:12,720
There we go.

150
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
Let's take some titanium white today.

151
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,979
And we'll reach up here and
I'll get a very small amount

152
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,120
of the dark sienna.

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,500
Don't want much, just
a little dark sienna.

154
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,581
A little bit, maybe I'll even

155
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:26,141
put a touch of the bright red in there.

156
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:27,122
Oh that's nice.

157
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:29,141
I just wanna flavor this a little.

158
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:32,004
Just enough to flavor it a little bit.

159
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:33,444
Now when you do yours,

160
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:35,544
you make the determination
how much you want.

161
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:37,283
Let me wipe the knife here.

162
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:40,024
And we just wipe our knife
on a clean paper towel.

163
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,925
Then we can cut off our
little roll of paint again,

164
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,606
so it's right on the edge of the knife.

165
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:49,607
And let's go up in here, no
pressure, no pressure touch.

166
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:52,810
And let that knife just
float, let it float,

167
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,050
let it float right down
the side of the mountain.

168
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,191
Think about where light would strike.

169
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,769
Okay let's go right in here.

170
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,069
Zoom, gotta make those little noises

171
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,269
or it doesn't work right.

172
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:05,549
There.

173
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,131
Just pull.

174
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,160
See there how easy that is though?

175
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,333
And you can change it to
any color that you wanted,

176
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,393
any color that you wanted.

177
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:17,812
Sometimes I like to do
this with a grey color

178
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,353
that looks like stones and rocks and,

179
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:23,074
depends on where you live.

180
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:26,834
Maybe in your world you
don't want a mountain.

181
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:29,975
Then you can paint this scene
and it'll be very beautiful

182
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:30,955
without a mountain.

183
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:31,875
It's up to you.

184
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,444
It's really up to you.

185
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:36,365
As we mentioned earlier, painting is,

186
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:39,406
is as individual as people are.

187
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:42,247
There.

188
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:45,997
Now then, we have to start thinking about

189
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,837
little things maybe, in my world,

190
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:51,138
I think there's a little light
gonna strike right there.

191
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,697
So we'll put a little
touch of light there.

192
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:55,818
And we'll take some white,

193
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,059
we'll use a little bit of
that mountain color with it.

194
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:02,209
And a little bit of phthalo
blue with it, what the heck.

195
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,829
Maybe a little more blue there.

196
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
And with that we'll make
us a nice shadow color.

197
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,579
Now this shadow color should
be lighter than the base color

198
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,300
that you put on your mountain.

199
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,690
But certainly darker than your highlights.

200
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,701
So somewhere in between.

201
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:20,372
You have to reach a happy medium.

202
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:22,422
Once again our little of paint, okay?

203
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:23,522
Let's go up here.

204
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:25,861
Now if this one's gonna
be the farthest away,

205
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:27,701
we'll do this little rascal first,

206
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:29,221
put a little bit of shadow right there.

207
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:30,401
All there is to it.

208
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,042
Now watch, watch.

209
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:33,902
Come distinctly through

210
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:36,173
and look how it pushed
that little devil back.

211
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,832
Bet you didn't realize
you had that much power.

212
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:43,202
But on this piece of canvas you have

213
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:45,122
total and complete power here.

214
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:47,383
You can do anything that you wanna do.

215
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:51,442
You can move mountains, rivers, trees.

216
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:54,692
You can determine what your world is like.

217
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,832
There's tremendous amount
of freedom on this canvas.

218
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,413
And that's what makes it fun.

219
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:03,943
That's what makes it fun.

220
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,863
Now then, and you can come back in here,

221
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:09,014
see this line is very straight.

222
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:10,783
Now we can come back in here

223
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,583
and we can put all kinds
of little ridges and bumps

224
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,983
and little places where the mountain goat

225
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:17,814
would have to live up here.

226
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,564
He's gotta have a little home too.

227
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,775
We'll just let that run right on down.

228
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:26,184
Okay, but each one of
these little projections

229
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:27,794
needs a little shadow.

230
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,946
Needs a little shadow
or it just won't play.

231
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,206
It'll go hide.

232
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:35,897
See how that little shadow
just brought it right out?

233
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,688
Watch though, maybe it
goes right over here.

234
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:40,929
I don't know.

235
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,299
Don't know, it's up to you.

236
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,960
You have to make these big decisions.

237
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:49,490
There.

238
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,071
But notice the angles here.

239
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:55,831
All the highlights are
going in one basic angle.

240
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:58,850
All the shadows are
going in one basic angle.

241
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,350
They vary a little, but overall,

242
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,951
overall they're going in the same angle.

243
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,931
'Cause if light's coming through here,

244
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:09,632
it's only gonna strike on a given angle.

245
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,631
Now with a good clean, dry brush

246
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:13,831
we can tap the base of this a little

247
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,091
and create the indication of mist

248
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:17,471
that lives right down at the bottom

249
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,471
of this big ole mountain here.

250
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,692
Lift gently upward, upward,

251
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,632
following the angles in the mountain.

252
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:25,391
And that removes the little tap marks

253
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,532
and brings it all together.

254
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:29,932
Over here go in this direction.

255
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:32,942
Tap a little and blend.

256
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:34,903
There.

257
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:38,632
Alright, now maybe we'll
get a little crazy today.

258
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:39,692
I like to do that.

259
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:42,952
Let's take, I'll use a
little of the mountain color

260
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,553
and we'll go right into some yellow,

261
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:48,933
I got a little cad yellow
here, a little yellow ochre,

262
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:50,993
we'll just use the same
old two inch brush.

263
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,354
Doesn't matter, maybe a little touch

264
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:54,445
of the sap green here and there.

265
00:10:55,085 --> 00:11:00,085
Maybe in our world there
lives some little trees

266
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:02,600
that sorta grow right up
the side of this mountain.

267
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,058
And to do that all you have
to do is take the big brush

268
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:09,899
and tap, but most, most important here,

269
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,159
we need to follow these angles.

270
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,624
Need to follow these angles.

271
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:18,553
If you don't, it just
absolutely won't look right.

272
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:23,186
Vary the colors between darker
green and lighter green.

273
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:25,175
Back and forth a little.

274
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:28,625
Just a little, maybe sort of determine

275
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,334
where you think a little
tree would live right here.

276
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,845
And how far up the mountain it would grow

277
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:36,325
before you reach the tree line.

278
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,946
Or, the place where it gets too cold

279
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:42,995
and too high for trees to live.

280
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,326
There.

281
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:46,607
If you've painted with me before

282
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:50,857
you know I lived in Alaska
for, well over a dozen years.

283
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,911
And I just absolutely fell in love

284
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,812
with the fantastic scenery that's there.

285
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:58,661
God was having a good
day when He made Alaska.

286
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:02,283
It is gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

287
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:04,345
There we go.

288
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:07,705
But these kinda sights
are pretty common there.

289
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:10,285
Now we'll take a clean, dry one inch brush

290
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:12,225
and very lightly, little short strokes.

291
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:14,425
I wanna grab that and lift upward.

292
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:17,164
Just lift it upward, upward, upward.

293
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:19,394
And sorta let it blend together a little.

294
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:23,315
And you just sorta work
back and forth here.

295
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:26,305
But gently, gently lifting upward.

296
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:28,296
Always going upward.

297
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,346
Think about the little trees,

298
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:31,885
even though they're
going at an angle here,

299
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,966
they would still grow straight up.

300
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:35,645
So keep these lines going straight up.

301
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:38,285
Sometimes the tendency,
the mountain go this way

302
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:40,535
to make your trees like that.

303
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:45,535
And it'll look like the big
giant sneezed or something

304
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:47,267
and blew 'em all over.

305
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:49,192
We don't want that.

306
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:52,841
And you can even touch a little
dark color here and there.

307
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:54,512
And just pull up the indication

308
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:56,773
of some that are a little darker.

309
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,847
You can continually
play this back and forth

310
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,717
between the darker greens
and lighter greens.

311
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:07,187
And it's a nice way of making
very effective little trees

312
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,317
that are growing up the
side of this mountain.

313
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,737
There.

314
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,108
Okay, shoot that's so much fun.

315
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,267
I tell you what, wash the old brush again.

316
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:20,718
I just look for reasons to wash the brush.

317
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,007
(chuckles)

318
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:27,430
Alright, we're in business again here.

319
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:29,989
Let's take, let's get crazy.

320
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,629
Let's have some fun.

321
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,210
We'll take some Prussian blue,

322
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,560
some Van Dyke brown, some midnight black,

323
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,331
maybe even a little sap green.

324
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:41,173
We'll just mix all those together.

325
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:42,312
Just mix 'em together,

326
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:46,212
make a big ole pile of dark color here.

327
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:49,653
It should look black, should look black.

328
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,974
Okay, now then, tell you what,

329
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:54,454
let me wipe the ole knife off.

330
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:57,874
Fact, we'll get a, let's get a fan brush.

331
00:13:57,874 --> 00:13:59,274
Shoot, that's fun.

332
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:01,934
I'm gonna load the fan brush
full of this dark color,

333
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:04,364
both sides, a lot of color.

334
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,355
Let's go right up in here.

335
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,895
Maybe in our world there's a little,

336
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,255
maybe there's a little
foothill that lives right here.

337
00:14:11,255 --> 00:14:12,116
Tell you what I'm gonna do,

338
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,536
I'm gonna add a little,

339
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:14,657
little bit of white to that,

340
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:15,877
I wanna lighten it just a little,

341
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,076
oh that's much better.

342
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:18,917
Went a little bit lighter.

343
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:20,418
There.

344
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:23,019
But there's some little footy
hills that live right here.

345
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,979
Some evergreen trees are growing on it.

346
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:27,319
And they're much closer to us.

347
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:29,509
Much closer to us.

348
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:32,639
So they're darker, they're much darker

349
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,729
than this background back here.

350
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:37,509
Just tap 'em down with the fan brush.

351
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:40,918
This is one of the neatest ways
that I've ever come up with

352
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:43,838
of making the illusion
of a lot of little trees

353
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,449
that live far away.

354
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,711
There we go.

355
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,932
And you determine how many
and where and all that.

356
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,512
There we go.

357
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:58,215
Now then,

358
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:02,005
we can take a clean, dry two inch brush

359
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:04,145
and I'm just gonna tap
the base here a little.

360
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:05,966
I wanna create a little bit of mist

361
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:07,985
at the bottom of these trees.

362
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:09,665
And this tapping will cause

363
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,746
the liquid white to come through.

364
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,706
And a little bit of that color will show.

365
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,247
Lift upward, just to
take out the tap marks

366
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:18,788
and bring it all together.

367
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,217
See there?

368
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,628
There we go, there we are.

369
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:25,008
Now then,

370
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:29,368
maybe, maybe in our world,

371
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:30,788
we'll just use that same old fan brush,

372
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:33,188
it's working so well
here, let's keep going.

373
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,988
Load a lot of the pure dark color on it.

374
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:37,949
Let's go right up here.

375
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:42,948
Maybe there lives a happy little
evergreen tree right there.

376
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:45,192
We just use the corner of the brush.

377
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:48,854
And just go back and forth, see there.

378
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:50,215
That easy.

379
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,754
And let's give him a few friends.

380
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:54,345
We don't want him to get lonely back here.

381
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,754
My gosh, with a scene like
he's got to look at here,

382
00:15:56,754 --> 00:15:59,434
he'd have to invite all of his
friends over to see it too.

383
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,074
This is just, this is just too nice

384
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:03,305
for him to keep for himself.

385
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,865
There's a little one.

386
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:08,914
Put the little guy right
up here in the front row

387
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:11,155
so he can see all of this too maybe.

388
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:12,895
There we go.

389
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:15,067
There we go.

390
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,157
Notice how these little
misty areas make those trees

391
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:21,878
really stand out.

392
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:24,468
That's why they're so important.

393
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,487
That's your separator,
that's your good friend.

394
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:30,460
That's your good friend, take care of him.

395
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,969
Take care of him.

396
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:36,509
And you put as many or as few
as you want in your world.

397
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,039
One thing that we're trying to do here,

398
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,438
is just to teach you a method.

399
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:43,059
We're really not trying
to teach you to copy.

400
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:44,759
That's the reason we have no patterns

401
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,682
or we don't do any tracings on the canvas.

402
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,831
We wanna teach you freedom
with this technique.

403
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,331
And turn you loose on the world.

404
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:57,771
Just absolutely turn
you loose on the world.

405
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:00,482
Because once you know the technique,

406
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:02,091
you can do anything.

407
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:06,320
Take a little blue, a
little tiny bit of blue

408
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,050
and white and a little
bit of the dark sienna.

409
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:14,566
Pull it out flat and get a
least little roll of paint

410
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,736
right out here on the edge of the knife.

411
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:20,339
And let's just make the
indication here and there

412
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,591
of a little tree trunk.

413
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,592
Right in there.

414
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,791
Or right, we don't want many,

415
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,251
'cause you wouldn't see all of 'em.

416
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,761
Oh you're just gonna see
a little here and there.

417
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,733
And you can just,

418
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,173
'cause you've picked up
some paint on your knife

419
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:37,493
you can just make the indication

420
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:41,394
of some little sticks and
twigs and all kinds of things

421
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,712
that are just projecting out of that.

422
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:48,436
Because in the woods, in the
forest, they're always there.

423
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,904
Now then, I have several
fan brushes going.

424
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,847
Let me just grab another one here.

425
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:54,008
Let's put some highlights on that.

426
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:56,709
We'll take a little,
little bit of the color

427
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,008
we made the trees out of,
'cause it has blue in it.

428
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,911
And mix it with some cad yellow

429
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:03,210
and a little yellow ochre
and a little Indian yellow,

430
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,401
what the heck.

431
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,169
And we'll make us a nice green.

432
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,431
If you want it darker,

433
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,568
add a little more of that tree
color to it and instantly,

434
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,469
because it has blue and black in it,

435
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:14,588
see, it gets darker.

436
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:15,549
That easy.

437
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:16,552
Let the paint work for you.

438
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,994
Let's go up here.

439
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:20,193
Now then our light's coming from the right

440
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:22,486
because our mountain tells us that.

441
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,896
So we wanna place more emphasis

442
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,665
on the right side of the
tree than on the left.

443
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:30,355
Then we just put the
indication of some highlights

444
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:32,605
that are showing through on these trees.

445
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:36,517
Now sometimes, sometimes
this gets feeling good.

446
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,796
And you cover up all the dark.

447
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,116
We don't wanna do that.

448
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:42,257
If we lose all that nice dark

449
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,916
then our tree becomes flat.

450
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,375
It's that darkness that's deep in the tree

451
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,616
that creates the illusion of shadows

452
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:51,945
and makes depth in the tree.

453
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:54,812
Otherwise it'll be a
very flat, little tree.

454
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,761
We don't want that, we
don't want any flat trees.

455
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,993
We want trees that, the son
of a guns have personalities.

456
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,483
They're like people, each one's different.

457
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:08,023
Some are tall, some are short.

458
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,253
Some are heavy, some are thin.

459
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,514
They're like people.

460
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:17,224
I mean this painting can
really and truly become

461
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,943
a world on its own.

462
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:21,723
You can find anything
that you want in here.

463
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:25,482
You can find peace, you can
find calm times, anything.

464
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:26,806
It's right here.

465
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:28,505
Shoot, let me get off my soap box here

466
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,885
and find a brush and let's get crazy.

467
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:33,887
Let's make a, let's make a
big evergreen right there.

468
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:37,446
And for that, I'm gonna, tell you what,

469
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:40,117
I'm gonna pick up the old oval brush here.

470
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:45,458
We'll go right into that same tree color.

471
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:46,908
Now this is the oval brush.

472
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,886
The end of it, let me hold
it up here so you can see.

473
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,047
The end of it's sorta round.

474
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:53,688
And it's easy to distinguish,
'cause it has a black handle.

475
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:55,468
And the rest of 'em have white handles.

476
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:57,479
Easy to tell the difference.

477
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,788
Okay pull it like that til it
comes to a nice, sharp edge.

478
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,108
Let's go up here.

479
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:03,088
Make a decision.

480
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:05,668
Maybe our big tree, we're gonna have one

481
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,489
that's gonna live right there.

482
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,389
We start out by just making a little line.

483
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:10,808
That sorta gives you a guide.

484
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:13,587
Take just the end of the brush.

485
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,087
Now this is gonna be one
of them big evergreen trees

486
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,639
that sorta saggy.

487
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:20,409
The limbs hang over.

488
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,269
I like this brush for
making these kinda trees.

489
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:25,529
See how the limbs hang.

490
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,401
Oh, I like that.

491
00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:31,172
But you can do this with a one inch brush

492
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:32,931
and have straight limbs.

493
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,091
You can do it with a fan brush.

494
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,671
I use a fan brush very often.

495
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,731
Or you can do it with a two inch brush.

496
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:40,211
It all works very well,

497
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:43,352
but if you want these hangy
down looking limbs like this,

498
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:47,341
I find it much better
to use this oval brush.

499
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,221
There.

500
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:52,323
Now then all we're doing here

501
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:57,973
is just placing in some
very basic little shapes.

502
00:20:57,973 --> 00:20:59,954
Just think about the arms on this tree

503
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,605
that live out here.

504
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,036
Where you want 'em.

505
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:05,405
There.

506
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:08,256
Maybe this old tree lives, I don't know,

507
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:10,286
somewhere down in here, we don't care.

508
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:11,996
I don't know, that was fun.

509
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:14,798
(chuckles) I like making
trees with that oval brush.

510
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,918
I tell you what, let's make another one.

511
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,919
Let's make another one.

512
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,070
Maybe our other tree, maybe
we'll have one right there.

513
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:24,259
And we start out the same way,

514
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,803
just make a little line.

515
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:32,043
And, back and forth, back and forth.

516
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:35,143
Just sorta let that rascal
come right outta that brush.

517
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:36,693
It lives in there.

518
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:39,523
He lives in there.

519
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:42,364
Ole tree now sometimes
they'll hide in there,

520
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,524
you have to sorta force 'em out.

521
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:47,586
But isn't that a fantastic way

522
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:51,096
of making some very beautiful evergreens?

523
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:54,537
Now, shoot, you know me.

524
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,488
I think everybody needs a friend.

525
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,958
So we're gonna give him one right here.

526
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:02,699
Right there.

527
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:06,018
There, see, there he comes.

528
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:11,468
And we're not concerned in this area.

529
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:15,057
That's all so dark, we'll
separate all that with highlights,

530
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:17,057
all that with highlights.

531
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:19,874
Let's take a little bit of that
color we had for our trunk,

532
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:22,404
and we'll just touch with the knife.

533
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:25,105
And just once again, we're
not gonna see much of it.

534
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:26,486
All we wanna do here,

535
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:29,386
is just show a little,
just here and there.

536
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:32,555
Just wherever you think it should show.

537
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:34,495
Like that.

538
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:38,216
I think I'll was the
ole oval brush out here.

539
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:42,315
Let's have some fun with
some highlight colors.

540
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:45,884
Okay now then for
highlights I'm gonna take

541
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:50,434
a little of that tree color
and mix it with the cad yellow.

542
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:55,404
And the yellow ochre and a
little of the Indian yellow.

543
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:57,286
But mix all these colors on the brush

544
00:22:57,286 --> 00:22:59,525
so you have a multitude of
things happening on the brush.

545
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,986
You don't end up with one dead ole color.

546
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,990
Alright, now then think about your light.

547
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,689
It's coming from the right.

548
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,769
Now we can go up in here

549
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:11,522
and just begin putting in the indication

550
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,471
of some beautiful highlights

551
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:15,785
that live right here on this tree.

552
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,315
See 'em?

553
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:18,865
There they are.

554
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:20,536
There.

555
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:22,486
Let's just put some in.

556
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,417
But this is where you make
all those old hangy down limbs

557
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:30,336
and we're going straight in
with the brush, straight in.

558
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:31,796
And just touching.

559
00:23:31,796 --> 00:23:35,615
Just touching, letting those
top part of the bristles,

560
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:38,405
just the top part of the bristles touch.

561
00:23:39,976 --> 00:23:41,477
Right there, see there?

562
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:44,846
Now then, let's go over
on the other side here.

563
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:47,117
And do the same thing for him.

564
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:50,469
If we left him out, shoot
he'd probably be angry.

565
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:52,341
Probably be angry.

566
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,660
We don't want that, we want
happy trees in our paintings.

567
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:57,539
(chuckles) I get some letters some times,

568
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,941
people say everything
in your world is happy.

569
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:01,701
And that's true.

570
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,921
We try to keep everything happy in here.

571
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,341
Shoot, if you want bad
stuff, watch the news.

572
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,069
In this world, we only
have pleasant things.

573
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,759
There.

574
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,500
Now then, sometimes it's fun.

575
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,550
I'll just dip this into a
little bit of the liquid clear.

576
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:21,539
And I want a real thin
color, much lighter,

577
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,340
but I use the clear to thin it.

578
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,400
And then it'll, it's very thin paint now.

579
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,221
You can go back up here and pick out

580
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:31,240
where you think light would
really zing through here.

581
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,103
And just put on a few sparklers.

582
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:35,922
Don't over do this.

583
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:37,305
Don't over do.

584
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:39,374
'Cause it gets good.

585
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:41,943
Just here and there.

586
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:44,527
But that clear thins the paint.

587
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:45,527
If you've painted with me before

588
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,646
you know our golden rule here

589
00:24:46,646 --> 00:24:49,366
is a thin paint will
stick to a thick paint.

590
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:52,786
We use very firm paint until
we get to the highlights.

591
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:55,948
And maybe just a few over in here,

592
00:24:55,949 --> 00:24:58,318
I don't want too many on this tree.

593
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,439
Just a few, there.

594
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,900
Alright, we're alright there.

595
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:06,769
Let's have some fun.

596
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,348
Now we have a transparent color here.

597
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:11,948
This was sap green and a
little bit of Van Dyke brown,

598
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:12,850
just to dull it.

599
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:16,690
I'm gonna take pure
white, just titanium white

600
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:17,990
on the two inch brush.

601
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,671
You have to make a big decision,

602
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,331
where is your water?

603
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,910
I want some water in here.

604
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:25,132
Touch this and pull it straight down.

605
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:27,464
It's important that it
comes straight down.

606
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,314
Then that sap green and Van Dyke brown,

607
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:33,413
they'll make some
beautiful, beautiful colors.

608
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,715
And it's fun to prepare this
canvas when nobody's looking

609
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:38,115
and when you do this,

610
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:39,855
especially if you're painting for someone,

611
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,195
they think it's magic.

612
00:25:41,195 --> 00:25:42,877
Now we go straight across.

613
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:45,797
And that'll create the illusion of water.

614
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:47,217
That easy.

615
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:50,397
Now take a one inch brush, put
a little liquid white on it

616
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:52,788
and go right through some of that color.

617
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:55,387
Just a nice green color.

618
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:57,757
And let's back in here, put the indication

619
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,837
of just a happy little bush
or two that lives right here,

620
00:26:00,837 --> 00:26:02,748
right on the edge of the water.

621
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,228
Something like that.

622
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:09,261
Little Van Dyke brown, a little
dark sienna mixed together.

623
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:13,961
And we can put the indication
of some land back in there.

624
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:15,063
See there?

625
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:16,422
That easy.

626
00:26:16,422 --> 00:26:17,783
A little bit of brown and white,

627
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:19,582
put a little highlight on it.

628
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,243
Shoot, we're in business.

629
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:22,123
A little bit more of that color.

630
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:26,092
Maybe there's a shoo, looky there.

631
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:29,582
Little bank lives out here too, see,

632
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:32,423
just sorta let that go,
barely, barely touching though.

633
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,065
And a little bit on the other side.

634
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:37,713
See, we can put another bank over here.

635
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,905
In your world, you make these decisions,

636
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:43,335
decide where all these little things live.

637
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:48,285
Take a little touch of the
liquid white on the knife.

638
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:50,765
And we'll just cut in a little water line.

639
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:54,206
And this separates, just separates.

640
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:56,997
It's just straight liquid white.

641
00:26:58,128 --> 00:26:59,987
A few little ripples here and there.

642
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:02,357
Shoot we 'bout have a finished painting.

643
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:08,207
I think that, I think
we'll call that one done.

644
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,948
But this is a good example of
how easy this technique is.

645
00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:12,449
So I look forward to seeing
you in the next show.

646
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:16,188
And until then, happy
painting, God bless my friend.

647
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:20,978
(bright music)
