1
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:05,938
(light music)

2
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:30,928
- Hi, welcome back.

3
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:32,908
Certainly glad you could join us today.

4
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:33,667
I thought today,

5
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,223
we'd do a different

6
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:36,003
little painting using some

7
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,083
of the liquid black

8
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:38,564
and liquid white.

9
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,183
So let's start out

10
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:39,981
and have 'em run all

11
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:41,130
the colors across the screen

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,850
that you need

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,890
to paint along with us.

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,629
While they'e doing that,

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,048
let me show you

16
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,266
what I got.

17
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,345
Got my standard old,

18
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:49,546
pre-stretched, double prime canvas.

19
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:51,515
Today, I've taken liquid black,

20
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:52,516
and put on the bottom.

21
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:53,457
And liquid white

22
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:54,157
put on the top,

23
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:55,615
it just blended in together.

24
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:58,036
So, the entire canvas is wet.

25
00:00:58,036 --> 00:00:59,237
But it's dark on the bottom.

26
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,197
That's the only difference.

27
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:02,393
Liquid black is just like liquid white,

28
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:04,832
only it has a black pigment in it.

29
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:05,813
And I use that a lot of times

30
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,734
when I know there's gonna be areas

31
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,132
that there's a lot of dark in.

32
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:11,131
The liquid black will make it

33
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:12,411
a lot easier for you.

34
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:13,111
Let's start today with

35
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,211
a little bit of Alizarin crimson.

36
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:16,131
Just a small amount

37
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:17,668
on a little two-inch brush.

38
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:19,289
Just a little.

39
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,150
Let's go up in here.

40
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,647
I want to put a little pink

41
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,267
in the sky.

42
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,387
But I don't want much.

43
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:26,947
I just want enough

44
00:01:26,947 --> 00:01:28,387
to warm it up some.

45
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:29,787
I don't want to set it on fire.

46
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:32,206
It's very easy to set it on fire.

47
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:34,956
Just want to warm it up.

48
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:35,966
Now, the crimson

49
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:37,146
is mixing with the liquid white.

50
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:39,605
It is a little liquid black there.

51
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:40,425
And automatically,

52
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:41,826
it will get lighter and lighter

53
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:42,925
in value.

54
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:44,305
That easy.

55
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:44,786
Okay.

56
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:45,606
That's about all I want

57
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,564
of the crimson.

58
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:48,683
There.

59
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:49,403
Now,

60
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:50,403
without cleaning the brush,

61
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:51,584
I'll go right into

62
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:52,784
some phthalo blue.

63
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:53,644
I like phthalo blue.

64
00:01:53,644 --> 00:01:56,285
It's a beautiful, beautiful blue.

65
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:56,763
Okay,

66
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:58,024
let's go up in here.

67
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:59,444
Now, we start right at the top,

68
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:01,445
using our Xs,

69
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:02,483
little cris-cross strokes,

70
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:04,983
go all the way across the top.

71
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:07,143
All the way across.

72
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:09,164
And then begin blending downward.

73
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,963
And be careful.

74
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,584
This blue is so much stronger

75
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:13,223
than the crimson.

76
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:14,944
It will eat up all the crimson

77
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:16,524
very quickly.

78
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:18,343
Very quickly.

79
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:20,323
So let's just have it

80
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:22,404
about like that,

81
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,164
and then clean your brush.

82
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:26,861
And we'll take the clean brush,

83
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:29,951
and blend them both together.

84
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,721
Just shake it off.

85
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:36,277
Beat the devil out of it.

86
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:37,257
That really is the fun part

87
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,768
of this whole technique.

88
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:40,457
I have more pleasure

89
00:02:40,457 --> 00:02:41,377
just beating the brush

90
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,357
than anybody in the country.

91
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:43,878
I have people now

92
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:45,677
that write me letters and say

93
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:46,899
they have no desire to paint.

94
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:47,798
They just bought a brush

95
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:48,557
so they can beat it

96
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,097
and take out their frustrations.

97
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:51,718
That's okay.

98
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:52,918
That's okay.

99
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,177
Alright.

100
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:56,299
Let's do...

101
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:57,199
Let's put some mountains

102
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,299
in there today, shoot.

103
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,718
Let's take some Prussian blue,

104
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:00,637
some black,

105
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,698
Alizarin crimson,

106
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:03,538
Van Dyke brown.

107
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:05,218
Just mix 'em together.

108
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,575
Mix 'em together.

109
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:10,126
Make a nice dark, dark color.

110
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:13,163
Put a little more crimson in it.

111
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,431
There.

112
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:15,792
Okay.

113
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:16,890
Now, the first thing we have to do

114
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,631
is decide where our mountain lives.

115
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,250
We'll cut off a little roll of paint.

116
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,830
There, you can see it.

117
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,410
Let's go.

118
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,669
Maybe there's a mountain,

119
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,269
lives right here.

120
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,350
Now, the only thing we're concerned about,

121
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,009
is the nice, outside edge.

122
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:30,850
We could care less

123
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,229
what's going on

124
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,189
anywhere except the top.

125
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:35,669
Right in there.

126
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,209
So, don't worry about it.

127
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,591
Don't let a mountain scare you.

128
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:40,310
They're really one of

129
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,689
the neatest things to paint

130
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,138
in this technique.

131
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,868
And still probably the most popular

132
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,548
thing we paint.

133
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:49,128
Alright,

134
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,127
I'm gonna take

135
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:50,787
two-inch brush,

136
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:51,427
grab it,

137
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:52,645
and pull.

138
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:53,764
Because there's liquid white

139
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,604
and liquid black underneath,

140
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:57,284
the color will move.

141
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:59,444
It'll allow you to blend the color

142
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:00,704
right on the canvas.

143
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:03,545
And it also removes excess paint.

144
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,524
So, the next layer will

145
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,765
be much easier to apply.

146
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:07,724
And we'll just let it fade

147
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,765
right into that,

148
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:10,965
like that.

149
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,125
See there?

150
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,905
That's all there is to it.

151
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,145
Let's take white,

152
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,985
white.

153
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:18,205
Grab some midnight black

154
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:19,385
a little bit and put in there.

155
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:22,781
I want to grey this a little bit.

156
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,860
So, we put a little bit of,

157
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,851
maybe even a touch of bright red.

158
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,218
It's our world,

159
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:28,056
we can do anything

160
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:30,375
that we want here.

161
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:30,956
Pull the paint out

162
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:32,456
as flat as you can get it.

163
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:33,375
Once again,

164
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,736
our little roll of paint.

165
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:36,296
Let's go up here.

166
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:37,235
Now then,

167
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,076
just decide where the light's coming from.

168
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:41,374
And if you're right-handed,

169
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:42,653
you'll find it's usually easier

170
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:45,074
to have it coming from the right side.

171
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:46,374
Left-handed,

172
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:47,914
try both ways.

173
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,093
Left-handed people,

174
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,373
have been forced

175
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,734
to do right-handed things

176
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,894
their entire life.

177
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:55,874
So some left-handed people

178
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:58,034
will find it easier to
highlight on the right,

179
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,055
some on the left.

180
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:03,033
It's a very individual thing.

181
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,414
There we are.

182
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:06,850
Little dooders in there.

183
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,011
Now, I'm just gonna,

184
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:10,691
pull a little bit of that color

185
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,810
down to make the shadows.

186
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,530
I don't want distinct shadows in here.

187
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:15,449
Just gonna pull

188
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,507
a little bit of it down.

189
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:18,627
Maybe,

190
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:19,548
right over in here,

191
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:23,399
there's a little bump right there.

192
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:23,918
See there?

193
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:24,959
You decide.

194
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,019
You decide where all

195
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:27,959
these little things live.

196
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,658
There.

197
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:30,599
And you can just place

198
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
some darks and lights

199
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,978
back and forth,

200
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:36,338
to create all kinds of illusions.

201
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:39,738
There you go.

202
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,608
Okay.

203
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,040
Now,

204
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,939
as I say,

205
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:45,659
it's your world.

206
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:46,618
You decide where you want

207
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:49,669
all these little rascals to live.

208
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:50,634
Okay,

209
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:51,995
we'll take a clean,

210
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,735
be sure its good and dry.

211
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:56,052
Clean, dry two-inch brush.

212
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:58,353
If it's not dry,

213
00:05:58,353 --> 00:06:00,653
it will dilute the paint,

214
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,134
and make it too soft.

215
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:04,033
So, be sure it's dry.

216
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,112
Follow the basic angles
in these mountains,

217
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,314
and tap.

218
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:08,254
All we're doing is trying

219
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:09,633
to take out

220
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:10,492
the little tap marks

221
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:12,892
and blend everything together.

222
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:15,032
And then, lift upward.

223
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:15,494
See?

224
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:16,234
Smooths it right out.

225
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,413
And it creates that illusion of mist,

226
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,002
right down at the base.

227
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:22,193
Sometimes,

228
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:23,893
it's a little too straight for me.

229
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:24,812
I'm gonna,

230
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,552
put a little dooder right there.

231
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,392
See?

232
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:28,452
It's all you gotta a do.

233
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:30,292
You can change your mind.

234
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:31,273
And it just makes it

235
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:34,391
a little more interesting.

236
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:35,838
Ready to get brave?

237
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,406
Let's do it.

238
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:41,206
That little mountain went so well.

239
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:41,961
(laughs)

240
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,800
This really is your bravery test.

241
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,550
Let's have a big mountain,

242
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:49,880
that lives right up here.

243
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,079
Right up here.

244
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,399
Maybe there's a little bump right there.

245
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,359
Don't be afraid of these mountains, shoot.

246
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Once you make friends with

247
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,400
this knife,

248
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,959
they're one of the neatest
things you can make.

249
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,599
And you do need

250
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,780
to make friends with the knife.

251
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,919
It takes a little time.

252
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,518
Takes a little time.

253
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:09,637
It's like anything else

254
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,077
when you do it at first.

255
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,397
It's a little foreign to you.

256
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,019
It takes a little while

257
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,367
to make friends with it.

258
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:17,459
Alright.

259
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,399
Very quickly,

260
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,458
with a little practice,

261
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,178
you'll be doing things

262
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:20,677
with a knife,

263
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:23,877
you just can't believe.

264
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,798
Okay.

265
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:26,978
There.

266
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:27,638
Here in the studio,

267
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:29,358
we just had a couple of

268
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,798
my young friends come in.

269
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:33,538
And,

270
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:34,937
they were only about,

271
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:35,677
one was six

272
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:37,177
and one was younger than that.

273
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:38,358
And they brought me some paintings

274
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,278
that they're doing.

275
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,115
It's unreal,

276
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:46,055
what young people can do with this too.

277
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:48,945
They were fantastic.

278
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:49,956
Okay, now.

279
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:51,276
We're just gonna blend that,

280
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:53,096
just let it go right and all,

281
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:53,756
whew.

282
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:54,796
We said we was gonna make

283
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:55,256
a big mountain,

284
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,091
we weren't kidding.

285
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:57,712
Once again,

286
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:59,192
our little roll of paint.

287
00:07:59,192 --> 00:07:59,771
Touch,

288
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,421
no pressure.

289
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:04,052
Absolutely no pressure.

290
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,532
Just let the paint glide

291
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,612
right along on there.

292
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,612
Let it glide.

293
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:10,812
You want it to break.

294
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:11,451
In other words,

295
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:12,432
have all these holes in it.

296
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:15,352
That's what makes it look interesting.

297
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:16,651
There maybe is a little light zinging

298
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:18,733
right on there.

299
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,091
Wherever,

300
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:22,589
it's up to you.

301
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,829
Painting gives you freedom.

302
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,089
Gives you creative freedom.

303
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,609
let's take some Prussian blue

304
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,290
and some white,

305
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,310
a little black in it,

306
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,059
just to dull it down some.

307
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,509
There.

308
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:36,490
We'll make us a little

309
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,370
shadow color.

310
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,509
Small roll of paint.

311
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:40,711
And once again,

312
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:42,269
just let it just glide

313
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:43,449
right along there,

314
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,311
like that.

315
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,129
Maybe out here,

316
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,230
just a little highlight

317
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,730
right in there.

318
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,610
We just sort of let them come together.

319
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,409
Just let your imagination take you

320
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,039
to any place that you want to go.

321
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,459
Look up there.

322
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,480
See there?

323
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,985
Just let it go.

324
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,485
Just let it slide

325
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:03,625
right down though there.

326
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,485
No pressure.

327
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,027
I know you get tired of hearing that,

328
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:08,427
but it's so important,

329
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:09,027
and it's probably

330
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:11,146
the single biggest mistake

331
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:12,685
that people make,

332
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,551
is apply too much pressure.

333
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,761
No pressure.

334
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,420
I'm gonna put some

335
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:21,389
little bumps and stuff in here.

336
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:22,798
And we can do that.

337
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:25,458
Put them anywhere that we want 'em.

338
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,308
There.

339
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,778
Just a little.

340
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,340
Maybe there's a little

341
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,278
dooder that lives over here.

342
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,479
Mountains grow every which way.

343
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,979
Just let 'em grow.

344
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,579
Let 'em go,

345
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,549
wherever they want to be.

346
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,107
There.

347
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:45,677
Just,

348
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,827
a few little things down in here.

349
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:52,548
Take a little more of our shadow color.

350
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,758
There.

351
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:57,018
But that creates the illusion

352
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:59,258
of all kinds of little dooders.

353
00:09:59,258 --> 00:09:59,898
And when you're at home

354
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,038
and have unlimited time,

355
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:02,658
shoot,

356
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:03,378
you can do

357
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:05,218
much better than this.

358
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:06,097
Much, much better,

359
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:07,127
I know you can.

360
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,607
There we are.

361
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:14,788
Wherever.

362
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:17,467
Wherever.

363
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:21,357
Okay.

364
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:23,727
Something about like him.

365
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,615
Now, let's get our brushes.

366
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:28,775
Nice and dry.

367
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:30,375
And let's just blend this,

368
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,415
very gently.

369
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,696
Just blend it.

370
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,537
We're tapping, following those angles.

371
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:37,156
Notice the angles are coming down,

372
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:37,676
like that,

373
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:41,266
and we follow those angles.

374
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,375
We follow,

375
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,216
okay?

376
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:45,615
Little bit of shadows,

377
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:46,275
right here behind

378
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:48,096
this little rascal.

379
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:50,405
Don't want him left out.

380
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:52,716
Then we can bring all

381
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,826
of that together.

382
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:56,376
Lift upward.

383
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:57,636
Takes out the tap marks,

384
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,915
brings everything together,

385
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,186
like that.

386
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:02,156
I'll tell you,

387
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:03,036
the best mountain painter

388
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,636
in this technique,

389
00:11:04,635 --> 00:11:06,235
is probably my son, Steve.

390
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:07,956
That rascal, whew.

391
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:10,615
He can paint some mountains.

392
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:11,295
Maybe we'll get him on here

393
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,917
before the series is over.

394
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:15,073
He travels and teaches

395
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:17,333
all over the country.

396
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,553
But, if we can get

397
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,615
that little rascal in here,

398
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:21,274
we'll have him come to the show.

399
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:22,014
Maybe I'll get him

400
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,312
to paint you a mountain,

401
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:27,719
because he can paint mountains.

402
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,908
Course, I sound like a proud Daddy

403
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:32,870
just keep yaking 'bout him.

404
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,649
And there's some truth to that.

405
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,169
There is some truth.

406
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,606
Okay.

407
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:41,427
That'll give us a pretty good,

408
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,226
little mountain.

409
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:43,807
I'm gonna have time

410
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:46,147
to do some other things than this.

411
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:47,204
Let's take

412
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:48,403
Prussian blue,

413
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:52,432
phthalo green, black, brown.

414
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,943
Oh, willing,

415
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:55,800
throw about any

416
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,120
old dark color in there.

417
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,759
I like to throw a little

418
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,980
of that phthalo green into it.

419
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,360
I'll make some evergreens.

420
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,179
It just gives them a nice,

421
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:05,120
nice color.

422
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,960
Alright.

423
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,620
Today, to make some evergreens.

424
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,420
Let's grab us a...

425
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:12,557
We'll use a fan brush.

426
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:13,577
We'll use the old fan brush.

427
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:15,677
You could use a one-inch brush,

428
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:16,158
whatever,

429
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:16,817
it doesn't matter.

430
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,877
Anything that works.

431
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:21,618
Load both sides with a lot of paint.

432
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,658
Let's go up in here.

433
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:25,975
And,

434
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:28,475
let's just tap in,

435
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,034
the basic indication

436
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,076
of some little evergreens,

437
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:33,913
that live far away back here.

438
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:34,592
They're far away.

439
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:35,372
They live right under the bottom

440
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:37,713
of this mountain.

441
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:38,972
It's one of the easiest ways

442
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:39,512
I've ever seen,

443
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:41,334
to create the illusion of

444
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,652
a lot of little trees, very simply.

445
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:47,143
Very, very simply.

446
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,214
But now,

447
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,973
one of the things that happens a lot,

448
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:52,332
sometimes there's too much distance

449
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:52,953
between 'em,

450
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:55,552
and they begin looking like fence posts.

451
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,112
If that should happen,

452
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:57,913
all you need to do

453
00:12:57,913 --> 00:12:59,332
is put a few more in there.

454
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,653
Just fill up the area.

455
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:02,483
There.

456
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:04,188
Because they're too far away,

457
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:04,928
you're not gonna see

458
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:07,308
a lot of detail.

459
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:08,848
Things that are far away,

460
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,969
you see only basic shape,

461
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:12,230
form,

462
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,428
and basic color.

463
00:13:13,428 --> 00:13:15,249
That's really about all.

464
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:15,810
Maybe we'll have 'em

465
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:19,038
coming over here too.

466
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:20,908
And to create that illusion

467
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:22,909
of distance in your painting,

468
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,668
avoid having too much detail,

469
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:25,805
when things are supposed

470
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,824
to be far, far away.

471
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,040
Yeah.

472
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,419
I know that sounds crazy,

473
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,199
don't put too much detail.

474
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,960
Sometimes we can absolutely

475
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,251
put too much.

476
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,541
Okay, here we are.

477
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,416
And we just sort of smash 'em down,

478
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,537
with the old fanbrush.

479
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:45,916
These fan brushes are marvelous.

480
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,516
They'll do wonderful, wonderful things,

481
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,555
where you paint an entire painting,

482
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:52,176
using nothing but the fan brush.

483
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:52,796
maybe we'll do that

484
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:55,196
in one of the shows sometime.

485
00:13:55,196 --> 00:13:57,637
Just to show you we can.

486
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,955
The big thing is time.

487
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:03,360
I'm gonna tap the base of that.

488
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,790
Like so,

489
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:06,689
there we are.

490
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,610
Now, we're gonna lift up.

491
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,249
It just smooths everything out.

492
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,949
Blends it right into the painting.

493
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:13,849
There we are.

494
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,319
Now we have a whole ridge

495
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:16,646
of just little trees

496
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,287
that live there.

497
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:18,846
Okay,

498
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,427
we'll just use that same old brush.

499
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,427
It's got,

500
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,628
put some sap green in it.

501
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,017
And it has a little bit of that

502
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:26,006
pine tree color.

503
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,905
So when we touch yellow,

504
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:28,865
we're gonna get

505
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:31,485
beautiful, beautiful greens,

506
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:34,605
that'll end in yellow.

507
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:35,765
And then I'll touch a little

508
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:36,825
of the bright red.

509
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:39,870
Bright red actually dulls the color.

510
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:41,741
I know it sounds crazy,

511
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,259
but red and green make brown.

512
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,919
So, when you put 'em together,

513
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,738
it dulls the color.

514
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:49,278
Now then,

515
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:50,519
yeah.

516
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:51,977
And notice I didn't have to put

517
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:53,057
any dark color in there,

518
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,798
because we used the liquid black.

519
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:56,977
That's what it's great for.

520
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:58,057
I knew there was gonna be

521
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,057
a lot of dark in there.

522
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:01,258
Didn't know exactly where,

523
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:02,557
but it doesn't much matter.

524
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:03,337
But I knew there was gonna

525
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:05,908
be a lot in there.

526
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:08,295
So,

527
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:09,495
Let's just take,

528
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:11,114
and begin tapping in

529
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:12,574
the indication

530
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:13,833
of all kinds of little things

531
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,813
that are happening back here.

532
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:18,474
Wherever.

533
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:20,413
There they are.

534
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,634
Just little happy dooders.

535
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:24,850
I make up words.

536
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,570
I'm very bad about that.

537
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,185
I often wondered,

538
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:29,806
we have the shows playing

539
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:32,246
in numerous foreign countries now,

540
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,561
I often wonder how they translate,

541
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:35,651
"Dooders."

542
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,071
There we are.

543
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,031
Alright.

544
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:46,681
I like to go to Mexico.

545
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:47,941
The show's been playing in Mexico

546
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,021
for several years,

547
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,280
Mexico City especially.

548
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,621
And, it's unbelievable,

549
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,740
some of the paintings

550
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,841
that our Mexican instructors

551
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:57,380
are coming up with.

552
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,641
Unbelievable.

553
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,382
Because, they've adapted this to,

554
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:04,069
the scenery that they see in Mexico.

555
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:05,739
And now,

556
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,320
we have a lot of instructors in Japan,

557
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,459
and they're doing exactly

558
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,858
the same thing.

559
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,429
So, they're teaching me now.

560
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,219
That's nice,

561
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:14,259
when you can have

562
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:15,548
and get so lazy

563
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:16,553
and let somebody else do it,

564
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:18,754
and let them teach you.

565
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:20,433
Here we are

566
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,370
See how that land flows downward?

567
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,049
I want it to look like

568
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,929
a little meadow back here,

569
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:27,070
where the land just flows,

570
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:30,186
just flows right down,

571
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,357
very soft.

572
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:35,176
There we are.

573
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:36,605
You make the decision

574
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:37,966
how far down it goes.

575
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:38,446
I tell you what,

576
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:39,826
I tell you what.

577
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:40,326
I'm sorry,

578
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:42,186
I get crazy.

579
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:43,696
(laughs)

580
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:45,225
When you paint like this

581
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:46,205
for any length of time,

582
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,245
you begin seeing things

583
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:48,725
in your painting.

584
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:49,765
When you see these things,

585
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,084
take advantage of 'em.

586
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,384
Take advantage of 'em.

587
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:52,904
Use 'em.

588
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:54,865
They're like gifts,

589
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,205
use 'em.

590
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:57,345
I want to,

591
00:16:57,345 --> 00:16:57,785
yeah.

592
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:58,326
I'll just do it.

593
00:16:58,326 --> 00:16:59,925
I just wanna put,

594
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:01,445
maybe do some more

595
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:03,965
evergreens here.

596
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:04,444
Yeah,

597
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:05,345
I'll put a

598
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,425
whole line here.

599
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:07,964
There.

600
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:09,144
I need all these trees,

601
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:10,326
cuz my little squirrel needs

602
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:12,005
a place to hide.

603
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:13,240
Tell you what,

604
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,694
I got another little piece of film here

605
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:15,414
I want to show you

606
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:17,095
about my little squirrel, Peapod.

607
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,794
He is just the cutest little devil

608
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:20,415
you've ever seen.

609
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,273
Now, how could you not

610
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,193
fall in love with someone like him?

611
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:25,313
Isn't he precious?

612
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,374
Thus is my little squirrel, Peapod.

613
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:29,214
He lives with me.

614
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,453
Well, actually he lives outside,

615
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:31,174
and he just,

616
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:32,453
cuz I've turned him loose

617
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,595
quite a while back.

618
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,074
He's full grown now.

619
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:38,235
He was just sort of a baby there.

620
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:39,615
But her still comes back,

621
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:40,914
everyday,

622
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:43,295
everyday.

623
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:43,994
And I feed him,

624
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:46,113
I'm soft-touched.

625
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,894
But, ain't he something?

626
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:49,115
I always have a lot of scratches

627
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,173
on my hands and stuff

628
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:50,815
and playing with him,

629
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:53,932
because they have very sharp claws.

630
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:55,451
The one thing I like to say

631
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:56,652
over and over,

632
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:58,231
we do not ever keep,

633
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:00,951
making these wild creatures pets.

634
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:01,912
I only raise 'em

635
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:04,393
and I turn 'em loose.

636
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:06,632
Because wild creatures,

637
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:07,772
that's where they belong.

638
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,451
They should be wild.

639
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:12,112
If you want to keep a creature,

640
00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:13,711
get a domestic animal.

641
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,051
Doggy or a cat.

642
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,153
They're a lot of fun.

643
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:18,612
They're a lot of company.

644
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:21,072
But, wild creatures are to be wild.

645
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,761
That's the way God intended it to be.

646
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:26,332
There we are.

647
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:27,032
But sometimes they need

648
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,311
a little help.

649
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,892
And if they do,

650
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:32,133
I jump right in there.

651
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,627
I like to play with them.

652
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,926
Like to watch them grow.

653
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:38,926
But these little squirrels,

654
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:39,526
when I get 'em,

655
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,527
a lot of times they're so small,

656
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:43,146
that their eyes aren't even open.

657
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:43,846
And then you have

658
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:44,446
to get up at night,

659
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:45,946
just like,

660
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:47,486
well, like I did with Steve

661
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:49,887
when he was a tiny, little baby.

662
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:50,587
And you have to feed him

663
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,260
two or three times every night.

664
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,680
Of course, Steve's not so tiny anymore.

665
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,700
He's over 6''5,

666
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,911
almost 6''6.

667
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,837
Must have fed him good.

668
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:03,817
Yeah.

669
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:04,917
That rascal,

670
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:05,677
certainly grew.

671
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,618
He out grew me.

672
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:10,337
We'll take a little bit of white.

673
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:11,518
I wanna create the illusion

674
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:12,558
of a little mist down here

675
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,077
at the base of these.

676
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:14,817
I'll show you why,

677
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:15,939
just to set it.

678
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:18,018
And I'll put some that's more distinct,

679
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:19,978
in this little misty area here,

680
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:22,018
this little misty area,

681
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:22,588
will turn out to be

682
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:23,408
your best friend,

683
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,979
because this will be your separator.

684
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:26,869
And you could just bang

685
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:27,588
it in any old way,

686
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:28,688
and then we'll just

687
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,569
tap it till it blends together.

688
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:32,826
Makes the base of the trees

689
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:34,698
look very soft and gentle.

690
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,882
There.

691
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:41,823
And most of this will disappear.

692
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:42,483
But here and there

693
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,082
and there and here,

694
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,363
we want to put a more distinct tree,

695
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:47,363
a bigger tree.

696
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:49,920
We'll put a little more paint on here.

697
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,538
Get all that phthalo green there.

698
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:53,769
Oh, I like it.

699
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,677
Brown and crimson.

700
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:57,738
I'll put some sap in there too,

701
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,679
I didn't have much phthalo.

702
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,238
And I want to have

703
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:02,307
a green tint to it.

704
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,555
Okay.

705
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:08,145
let's see what we got here.

706
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,115
Maybe,

707
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:11,756
you know, Bobby.

708
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:14,775
Gotta have a big tree in here somewhere.

709
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:16,375
Gotta have a big old tree.

710
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,914
Here it comes.

711
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:21,815
There we are.

712
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:22,855
We'll put some highlights

713
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,752
on there and separate it.

714
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:26,952
That'll separate it right apart.

715
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:28,952
Let's give him a friend.

716
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:31,314
There we go.

717
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,533
Right there.

718
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:33,932
I know it's hard to see right now,

719
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,294
but, we'll separate it.

720
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:36,973
We'll separate it.

721
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:37,732
Maybe here and there

722
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:38,913
we can put the indication

723
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:40,393
of a few more,

724
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,133
a little closer to us,

725
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:42,692
a little bigger,

726
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:45,863
a little more detail.

727
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:46,992
And then that

728
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:49,333
little misty area will separate 'em.

729
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:51,996
We'll just put a few in here.

730
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:53,096
You decide in your world

731
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:55,546
how many there are.

732
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,536
There we go.

733
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:01,064
Something like that.

734
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,632
I need one down here.

735
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:07,542
Just right there.

736
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:09,272
Okay.

737
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:10,011
Now,

738
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:11,653
without doing anything

739
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:12,310
to that brush except

740
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,430
going through yellow,

741
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:15,911
because it has blue and black in it,

742
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:18,891
you'll make a beautiful green color.

743
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:21,531
That'll give us the highlight.

744
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,010
Okay?

745
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,711
Let's go back up here.

746
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:25,371
Same old brush.

747
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,571
There we are.

748
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,230
Now, we can put in

749
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,871
a few little highlights.

750
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,451
Don't kill all your dark color.

751
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:33,131
I know it's tempting.

752
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:34,071
A little yellow ochre,

753
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,520
Indian yellow just mixed in there,

754
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,289
change of flavor.

755
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:39,009
But don't kill all the dark.

756
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:40,910
Evergreens are normally

757
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,590
pretty dark trees.

758
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,687
Leave 'em that way.

759
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:46,768
There.

760
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:48,428
A little over in here.

761
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:49,588
I'm just bopping around here

762
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:50,707
trying to get these put in

763
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,668
as quick as I can.

764
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,548
I'll put a few more little things

765
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:55,107
in this painting,

766
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:56,147
it's a lot of fun.

767
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:59,107
This liquid black, try it.

768
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:00,107
Try it.

769
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:03,577
I think you'll find it
does wonderful things.

770
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,748
Now then,

771
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:06,385
maybe,

772
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:08,305
yeah, why not?

773
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:10,325
Let's start.

774
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:12,825
We'll put in some little grassy areas

775
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:14,744
and there.

776
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:16,043
Little yellow.

777
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:16,804
I'm gonna dip the brush

778
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:19,524
into at least a little
touch of paint thinner.

779
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:21,023
Just enough to thin the paint

780
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:22,863
a tiny bit.

781
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:24,284
We're getting quite

782
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:26,504
a buildup of paint on here.

783
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:28,083
So we need

784
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:30,923
to paint this a little thinner.

785
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:32,423
See it there?

786
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:34,003
Look at all the layers in this painting.

787
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:35,003
I mean,

788
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:38,265
it just goes on and on and on.

789
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,795
And you can do it so simple.

790
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:45,036
There we are.

791
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:45,934
Okay,

792
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:46,894
and maybe a little touch

793
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:48,576
of the bright red here and there.

794
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,894
I like it.

795
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:52,373
I like it with red in there,

796
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:55,211
it does nice things.

797
00:22:56,282 --> 00:22:57,509
Okay.

798
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,528
We need a little path in there.

799
00:22:58,528 --> 00:22:59,568
Let me take a little Dark Sienna,

800
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:01,568
Van Dyke brown.

801
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:04,628
Gotta have a way to get in there.

802
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:06,088
We'll just put us a little path

803
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:08,807
right in there.

804
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:11,407
Mostly Dark Sienna.

805
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:13,947
Put a little of the Van Dyke,

806
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:15,208
and we'll let it wander right

807
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,688
on out through there.

808
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,648
Little brown, little white.

809
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:22,107
Just enough to put the indication

810
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:24,548
of a little highlight on there.

811
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:25,867
There, see?

812
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,086
It's that easy.

813
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:29,645
Just like you're putting snow

814
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:31,547
on the mountain.

815
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:32,707
Maybe,

816
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:33,586
I know.

817
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,687
(laughs)

818
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:37,226
Let's take a little black.

819
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:38,646
Maybe come right up in here.

820
00:23:38,645 --> 00:23:40,326
Maybe there's just a little stone

821
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:41,944
that is right there.

822
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:44,884
Happy little stone.

823
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:48,129
We put in dark first.

824
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,839
And we come back with some brown,

825
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,179
white, a little black in it.

826
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,259
And let's put a little highlight on that,

827
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:58,118
just enough to make it interesting.

828
00:23:58,118 --> 00:23:59,859
Just enough, see?

829
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:00,779
Pull a little but of it down,

830
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:03,308
not much, not much.

831
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:05,559
Alright.

832
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,058
Then, some little grassy areas

833
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:08,549
right around his foot.

834
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:13,784
Bring the path all into the painting.

835
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:16,465
There.

836
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:17,413
Alright.

837
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:19,574
Got just a minute left here.

838
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:20,134
Tell you what,

839
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:21,913
I'll need a tree in here.

840
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:23,714
I need a little tree.

841
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:25,850
My producer right now

842
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:28,331
is gonna kill me for doing this.

843
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,625
Right there is a little tree.

844
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,335
And we'll take,

845
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:35,865
a little light color,

846
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:38,004
just tap the side here

847
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:42,151
Give it some highlight.

848
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:43,441
Grab a liner brush,

849
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,981
put a couple little tree branches on it.

850
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:47,422
This old tree is dead.

851
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:51,211
This old tree had a bad day.

852
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:53,201
Old evergreen tree,

853
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,061
you just need some little

854
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:56,661
limbs hanging out through there.

855
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,501
Wherever.

856
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:00,392
Not many left,

857
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:03,321
just a few.

858
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:05,432
See?

859
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:07,663
But that's really all there is to it.

860
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:10,792
Hope you've enjoyed this little painting.

861
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,072
It's something different.

862
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:14,293
Shows you how to use the liquid black,

863
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:15,811
and I believe it'll bring you

864
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:17,792
fantastic results.

865
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:18,772
From all of us here,

866
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:20,572
I'd like to wish you happy painting,

867
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:22,823
and God bless, my friend.

868
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:28,017
(light music)
