("The Joy of Painting" by Larry Owens)

2
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:31,650
- Hello, I'm Bob Ross.

3
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,530
And I'd like to welcome you
to our fifth painting series.

4
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,171
If you've been with us before,

5
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:37,692
I hope you have your
almighty easel set up,

6
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:39,451
and you're all ready to go along with me

7
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:41,012
and paint a fantastic little painting.

8
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:42,591
And let's go across the colors

9
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,070
that we're going to use.

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,121
I'll have them graphically run

11
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:46,420
the colors across the screen,

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,310
starting with the titanium white,

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,661
and going all the way around.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,990
and they'll come across your screen

15
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,750
in the same order that I
have them on my palette.

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,131
If you haven't been with us before,

17
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:55,680
hang around.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,491
I think you'll really
enjoy what we're gonna do.

19
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,271
I've already covered the canvas

20
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:01,051
with a thin, even coat of Magic White.

21
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:02,771
And the Magic White, it makes the canvas

22
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,251
wet, makes it slick.

23
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:07,370
It allows us to literally blend
color right on the canvas.

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,470
So, let's go up here and do it.

25
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:10,912
And I'll start with a big old

26
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,151
two and a half inch brush today.

27
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,450
And we'll go right into a
little bit of thalo blue.

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,971
And we'll just work some of that

29
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:17,230
right into the bristles here.

30
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,271
Just beat it into the bristles,

31
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,210
so you have a nice, even
distribution of color.

32
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,170
(thumping)

33
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:24,722
Kay, let's go up to the canvas here.

34
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,141
Maybe we'll make a, let's just make a

35
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:27,322
happy little sky here.

36
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:29,192
We just use a little,
little criss-cross strokes.

37
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,922
(brushing)

38
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:33,162
And just let the brush
just sort of bounce around

39
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:34,121
and play and

40
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,522
just let it have fun.

41
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:38,152
Let it have fun.

42
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,151
A little more color.

43
00:01:40,152 --> 00:01:41,701
And we'll go up here in this corner.

44
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,661
(brushing)

45
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,532
And I'm not coloring the
entire canvas evenly.

46
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:46,272
I'm leaving some little
spots here and there that

47
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,182
oh, hopefully when we're
done it'll look like

48
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:50,822
some happy little clouds
floating all across the sky.

49
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:53,671
There.

50
00:01:54,522 --> 00:01:55,792
(thumping)

51
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:57,781
Now, it's easy, it's real
easy to make the sky darker.

52
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,682
But, it's a son of a
gun to make it lighter.

53
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:01,972
(scraping)

54
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:04,762
So, use very, very little
color when you first start.

55
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:06,382
You can always go back and add more color.

56
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:10,341
Now, while I've got this
old dirty brush going here,

57
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,562
I'm gonna reach right up into this color,

58
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:14,201
which is a little bit of thalo green.

59
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,481
And we want very, very small amounts.

60
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:18,562
Extremely, extremely strong.

61
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:21,423
And we'll just mix it right on the brush.

62
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,441
There we go, a little
thalo green and thalo blue.

63
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:26,074
Okay, let's go back up here.

64
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:27,894
I wanna have some water in this painting.

65
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,173
I love water.

66
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:31,734
And water is always level.

67
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,074
It's still water, it's always level.

68
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:35,174
(scraping)

69
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:37,014
So, just come across.

70
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:38,354
Try to keep the strokes

71
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:39,674
as straight as possible.

72
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:42,953
Okay, now let's go to the other side,

73
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:44,152
and pull this way.

74
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:46,503
(scraping)

75
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:49,074
Painting, see how the color's blending in.

76
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:51,995
It's continually mixing
with the Magic White.

77
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,776
Now, you could do all these
things on the palette,

78
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,776
but they would take you a long time.

79
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:00,515
Here we let it happen on
the, right on the canvas.

80
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,135
(scraping)

81
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:04,575
Mkay.

82
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:07,034
Now, I'll wash the brush.

83
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:10,055
And we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner.

84
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:13,396
I never, never wash my
brushes with turpentine.

85
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:16,214
Only with odorless paint thinner.

86
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,015
(tapping)

87
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,235
Shake off the excess.

88
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:21,145
(banging)

89
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,835
And, that's the most fun of all.

90
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,115
Now, with a clean, dry brush,

91
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:27,314
I'm gonna go back into the sky

92
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:29,014
and just very quickly,

93
00:03:29,014 --> 00:03:30,715
blend it out a little bit.

94
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:31,895
(fast scraping)

95
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,665
Those light spots remain.

96
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:35,573
There.

97
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,183
Just let this happen.

98
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:40,155
We really just sort of let it just flow

99
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,794
right out of our mind,
right onto the canvas.

100
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:44,574
And you don't have to spend a great deal

101
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:45,894
of time planning and worrying.

102
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:47,854
Just let it go. Let it go.

103
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:50,715
Mkay.

104
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:51,955
Tell you what, let's do.

105
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:53,493
Let's take an almighty fan brush here,

106
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,293
and we'll make a happy little cloud.

107
00:03:58,253 --> 00:03:59,913
And I'm using a number six fan brush,

108
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:03,405
and some titanium white.

109
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,115
Tell you what, let's put the least

110
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:06,495
little amount of permanent red in there.

111
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:07,924
Put a little sunshine on it.

112
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:10,413
Want some sunshine in our clouds.

113
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:11,954
Load a lot of paint into the bristles.

114
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:14,034
Lot of paint.

115
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,895
Kay, now let's go up to the canvas here.

116
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:16,975
Maybe.

117
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,655
Maybe, maybe, right here.

118
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:20,653
Using just the corner of the brush.

119
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:22,355
We'll put a happy little cloud.

120
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,775
And clouds are very, very free.

121
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:27,995
Very free, just let 'em
bounce around and play.

122
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:31,033
And we're looking for
areas here that are thick,

123
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:32,913
areas that are thin,
areas that have no paint.

124
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:34,874
Keep the brush moving.

125
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:35,955
Keep it moving.

126
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:37,435
If you let it stay in one place,

127
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:38,675
and keep doing this, you're gonna

128
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,130
you're gonna end up with a
big cotton ball up in the sky.

129
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,170
Let it move.

130
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,990
(scratching)

131
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,050
I tell you what, let's go
over to the other side here.

132
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,471
Maybe there's a happy little cloud that.

133
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:52,910
Yeah, there was.

134
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:55,390
He lives right there.

135
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,560
Just let him go.

136
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,149
There he is.

137
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:03,389
And you put these clouds
wherever you want 'em.

138
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,689
This piece of canvas is your world.

139
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,189
It's your world.

140
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,668
And you make your world
the way you want it.

141
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:16,798
Now then, I'm gonna take

142
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:19,347
a clean, dry, two and a half inch brush

143
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:21,410
And I wanna blend, I want to blend

144
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,830
the bottom of these clouds out

145
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,389
without touching the top.

146
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,209
So let's start right
here, and very lightly.

147
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,288
Very lightly, very lightly.

148
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:30,628
Three hairs and some air.

149
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,886
Just let it caress the canvas.

150
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,076
Barely, barely, barely touching.

151
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,435
Blend the bottom out.

152
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:40,955
Leave the top of the cloud alone.

153
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:42,156
Kay, let's do this one.

154
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:43,115
And work in layers.

155
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:46,276
(scratching)

156
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,478
Kay now, let's fluff this cloud.

157
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:50,919
Now watch what happens.

158
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,300
We're gonna lift this cloud up.

159
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,639
And you're gonna pull little,

160
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,359
little stringy things of paint up,

161
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:57,318
don't worry about 'em,
don't worry about 'em.

162
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:00,158
You want those to happen right now.

163
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,519
And then very lightly, you just blend 'em,

164
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,559
and it brings all of it together.

165
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:08,878
Kay, let's do that again
over here on the other side.

166
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:11,039
Just blend the bottom of the cloud out.

167
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,979
(scraping)

168
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,059
Just like so.

169
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,840
Fluff it up.

170
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,979
And then blend it.

171
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,200
And this little son of a gun here,

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,709
we don't want to forget him.

173
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,159
And we'll just blend him out.

174
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,689
And fluff him up.

175
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,058
And then very lightly,

176
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,400
very lightly.

177
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,718
And that easy,

178
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
that easy, you've got some beautiful,

179
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,360
beautiful, very effective little clouds.

180
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,038
Okay, I'll wash my brush.

181
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,319
There's a screen in the bottom of this can

182
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,740
that I scrub the brush against.

183
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,278
It really helps.

184
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:49,456
Helps get the paint out of the brush.

185
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:53,477
I tell you what, my home
is in Fairbanks, Alaska,

186
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,915
so I'm sort of hung up on mountains.

187
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,356
So let's build a fantastic
little mountain here.

188
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:01,216
Go ahead and take some thalo blue,

189
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:03,857
some Van Dyke Brown,

190
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:08,276
and we'll use a little
bit alizarin crimson.

191
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:10,757
So we have thalo blue, Van Dyke Brown,

192
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:13,257
and a small amount of alizarin crimson.

193
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,216
Now, the more crimson you put in,

194
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:18,055
the more purplish your
mountain's gonna be.

195
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:20,075
Pull this paint out very flat,

196
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:23,576
and just cut across it so you
have a small roll of paint.

197
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:26,375
There, right out on the edge of the knife.

198
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,596
Let's go up here.

199
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,716
Now, you have to make some
decisions in your world.

200
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,515
Where's the mountain gonna live?

201
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:35,855
I'm gonna have my
mountain live right there.

202
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,976
And you're really, really pushing

203
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:39,635
this paint into the canvas.

204
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:42,457
Really push it into the canvas.

205
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:46,296
And anywhere you decide there's a bump

206
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:47,737
or hill or big stone,

207
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:49,727
put it in.

208
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:50,975
Put it in.

209
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,776
(short scraping)

210
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:55,257
This is where ya exert your

211
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:57,776
fantastic power

212
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:58,836
is right here.

213
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:02,246
Kay, now

214
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,556
See you scrape off the excess paint.

215
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,597
(scraping)

216
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:09,747
And the canvas will keep what it wants.

217
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:13,086
The value is in the material.

218
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:14,958
Kay, now, I wanna remove more

219
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,198
excess paint and blend this out.

220
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:17,536
Because the canvas is wet,

221
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,996
this paint will move, it'll slide.

222
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:21,516
You can move it all over the canvas.

223
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,577
There we go, and just pull it out.

224
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,197
And when you're painting mountains

225
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:29,157
always remember

226
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:30,658
if you can see the entire mountain

227
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:33,358
it's always more distinct at the top

228
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,977
than it is at the bottom.

229
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:37,217
At the bottom of the mountain

230
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,457
we have mist and

231
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:41,137
now we have pollution.

232
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:42,936
All these things have a tendency

233
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:44,898
to break up and diffuse light.

234
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:48,878
And you can see from that the top

235
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:50,618
of the mountain's very
dark, it's very strong.

236
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:52,538
And down at the bottom of the mountain

237
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:55,077
then it's very soft and quiet, peaceful.

238
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,937
And that's what we're looking for.

239
00:08:58,368 --> 00:08:59,177
Kay, now I'm gonna go

240
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:00,418
right into my titanium white.

241
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,018
We'll put a little snow on this mountain.

242
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:03,817
Little bit of snow.

243
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:04,997
Pull it out very flat.

244
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:06,598
Very, very flat.

245
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:07,916
Just like we did before.

246
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,758
And then cut across it.

247
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,518
Get that small roll of paint.

248
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:13,848
Okay, let's go up here.

249
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:16,128
Now, you have to make some decisions.

250
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,869
Which one of these peaks
is the farthest away?

251
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,330
The one that's farthest
away, let's do it first.

252
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,569
There. Just follow
right down the mountain.

253
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,090
No pressure. Absolutely no pressure.

254
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,918
No pressure.

255
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:35,489
All that's touching the canvas is that

256
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,149
little roll of paint that's on the knife.

257
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,590
And then you begin thinking about

258
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,469
where the light would strike as it

259
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:43,621
just comes through here.

260
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:45,068
Now, some people find it easier

261
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,549
to put the shadow on first.

262
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,389
Personally, I like to put
the highlight on first.

263
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:51,949
And then put the shadow in later.

264
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:53,938
But, either way that works for you.

265
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,279
There are no set, firm rules in painting.

266
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,970
You find what works for you.

267
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,409
And that's what you do.

268
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,978
(light scraping)

269
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,700
There we go.

270
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,039
And you can bring this down to

271
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,120
wherever you want it.

272
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,000
You can end up covering your
whole canvas with mountains,

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
which is a super way to practice.

274
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,778
I'm gonna take some thalo blue

275
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:20,158
and titanium white and
we'll mix that together.

276
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,579
And to that, I'm gonna add a
small amount of Van Dyke Brown.

277
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:24,558
The brown is there

278
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,879
just to dull it down.

279
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,959
And I'm not worried about overmixing that.

280
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,778
Just leave that paint marbled.

281
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:32,698
Okay, and once again we'll
take that little roll of paint.

282
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,919
Let's go up here.

283
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,820
And, we'll go in the opposite direction.

284
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,840
The opposing direction,
whatever you wanna call it.

285
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,980
And, put in some shadows.

286
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,679
And every shadow

287
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,639
needs it's own little, private highlight.

288
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,899
Or he won't play.

289
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,259
He'll just disappear on ya.

290
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,460
Look at that, look at that.

291
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:55,720
I've painted for over
20 years and it still

292
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,440
excites me to see these things happen.

293
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,028
It's unbelievable.

294
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,680
I was a traditional painter for many years

295
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,379
and I suffered and ah my gosh.

296
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,119
Would spend weeks and weeks

297
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,519
and weeks on a painting.

298
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,280
And when I got finished
I had turned it to mud.

299
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,500
Or I was so tired of looking at it,

300
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,859
I didn't want to paint on it anymore.

301
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:15,859
And this

302
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:18,139
this offers you unlimited freedom.

303
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,009
Unlimited freedom.

304
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,350
And that's what we're all looking for.

305
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,229
Little bit of highlight right there.

306
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,999
Now, let's just sort of
bring these together.

307
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,480
Maybe it comes from right here.

308
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,500
And just let it

309
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
just let it sort of work together.

310
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,038
I guess I'll

311
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:37,979
come right there

312
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:40,469
Just like that.

313
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:42,389
And you can keep adding

314
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:45,518
just wherever you think there should be a

315
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:47,117
almighty peak.

316
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:48,798
That's where it should be.

317
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:50,116
(scraping)

318
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,546
There.

319
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:55,997
And on this series, we're gonna try to

320
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,516
I'm gonna bring in a couple of friends.

321
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,038
I think I'll bring in a couple of friends

322
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:01,488
and let them to show you some

323
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,327
fantastic things that can be done.

324
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:07,708
The more people that
you see that can do this

325
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:11,148
the more you'll understand
that you can do it too.

326
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,817
There's no big secret to it.

327
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,938
Anybody can do it if they're

328
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,266
willing to practice a little bit.

329
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,408
Now, we'll take the large brush.

330
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:21,887
I wanna create some mist down here.

331
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:24,528
So, here I'm tapping.

332
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,027
Just lightly tapping.

333
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,347
Paying particular attention to the angles.

334
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,327
Always follow the angles in your mountain.

335
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:31,846
And then we'll lift up.

336
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:35,696
Very lightly, lift upward.

337
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:38,117
And look at that.

338
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:40,406
Creates a very soft misty, misty effects.

339
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,177
Maybe, let's play a game.

340
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,447
Let's play a little bit here.

341
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:46,026
Maybe one of these peaks here

342
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:49,867
show you how to bring a mountain.

343
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:52,697
Oh let's, I tell you what.

344
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,127
We're having such a good time here,

345
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,606
show you something else
too while I'm here.

346
00:12:57,606 --> 00:12:59,666
I'm gonna take a little of the Magic White

347
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,387
and add it right into my titanium white.

348
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:02,986
So it's a little bit thinner.

349
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,607
One of our golden rules.

350
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,787
Thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

351
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:08,067
And I wanna

352
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,016
I wanna put a cloud coming
right across the mountain here.

353
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,477
Just, let it come right across.

354
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:14,817
You know, these old clouds,

355
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,307
they just sort of drift across a mountain.

356
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:19,317
So, just barely touch.

357
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:20,668
And this is a thinner paint

358
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,547
and it'll stick on top of that thick paint

359
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,307
that's already up there.

360
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,407
Okay, maybe he's got a little friend

361
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,067
that lives right here.

362
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,479
And maybe, shoot who knows.

363
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,698
Maybe there's a happy little cloud

364
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,678
that he sort of, maybe
he fell out of the sky,

365
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,738
and he just floating right down here

366
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,158
at the bottom of this mountain.

367
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:41,638
And, we'll take the big brush.

368
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,239
Just blend that.

369
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:45,937
Looka there.

370
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:47,237
Fluff it up.

371
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,238
Fluff it up, up.

372
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:51,859
And then very lightly, we'll
just blend all this together.

373
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:53,918
And we'll put a happy little cloud

374
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,518
right there at the bottom of the mountain.

375
00:13:57,148 --> 00:13:59,480
And you can put as many of
these in here as you want.

376
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,220
(scraping)

377
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,931
And maybe, tell you what.

378
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:05,070
Let's just bring this one

379
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,590
right down in front of the cloud.

380
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,649
And you can just keep
adding on and on and on.

381
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,920
Wherever you want it to go.

382
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:14,719
Look at that.

383
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,450
(scratching)

384
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,706
Look at that.

385
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:20,227
Then we'll drop a happy
little shadow here and there.

386
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,726
See how that shadow makes it just pop out.

387
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,377
That's where it happens.

388
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:31,165
Now, we could spend the whole show

389
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,507
working on mountains here.

390
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:35,286
But, I'm sure we wanna
look at some other things.

391
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,926
So we'll just put some mist right here.

392
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,626
(bump scratching)

393
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,026
Over here, we follow these angles.

394
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:43,772
Soften all this up.

395
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:46,351
And go from there.

396
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:50,653
And that easy.

397
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:52,622
Now you can see how
this plane projects out.

398
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:54,603
The little mist in here and the softening.

399
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,642
It just brings it right out.

400
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,841
Tell you what, I'm gonna mix up

401
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:04,521
we'll just use the same mountain color

402
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:06,623
and we'll put sap green into it.

403
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:09,522
So we have blue, brown a
little alizarin crimson

404
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:12,543
and now a touch of sap green into it.

405
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:16,022
(scraping)

406
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:17,463
Just a little though.

407
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,701
Okay. Now let me clean my knife.

408
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:22,472
We'll use the fan brush.

409
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,163
And I'll just quickly
lay a little on here.

410
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:26,163
Now, I wanna have maybe,
like a little tree line

411
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:27,621
going up the side of this mountain.

412
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,682
So I wanna do in here where
the fan brush is just touching.

413
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,162
And you still, still need to follow

414
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,602
the angles in that mountain.

415
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,721
Always follow the angles in that mountain.

416
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:40,524
And that easy. That easy.

417
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,543
You can put a whole forest nearly

418
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,581
just climbing right up
the side of the mountain.

419
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:49,173
There we go.

420
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:51,172
And all we're doing is laying
it on with the fan brush.

421
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:52,603
(tapping)

422
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:53,741
Just lay it on.

423
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:58,293
Then we'll take a one-inch
brush, just clean and dry.

424
00:15:58,293 --> 00:15:59,782
And very lightly

425
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,263
begin lifting straight up.

426
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:02,862
Just straight up.

427
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,629
There we go.

428
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,129
Barely, barely touching.

429
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:10,429
Now this softens and
brings everything together.

430
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:13,459
That easy.

431
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,204
That easy.

432
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:16,722
You know it's hard for me to believe

433
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:19,024
that we're into our fifth series.

434
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:21,304
Oh my gosh it was

435
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:22,903
it's

436
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,864
you can't believe what wonderful things

437
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:27,263
it does to my heart to know that

438
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:29,564
you've allowed me into your home

439
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:32,623
this many times and you're
inviting me back again.

440
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:35,024
You've

441
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:36,647
literally made a dream come true.

442
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,247
All my life I have wanted to

443
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:39,746
to be able to share

444
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:42,346
my views of nature

445
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:45,006
with everybody.

446
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:47,567
And you've allowed me to do it.

447
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,547
And now,

448
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:51,367
I want to thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

449
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:53,385
It's very special to me.

450
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:56,667
Kay, let's go up here.

451
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,706
Maybe

452
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:59,008
back in here there's

453
00:16:59,008 --> 00:16:59,887
There it is.

454
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,025
You knew it was there.

455
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,386
Some happy little trees
that live way back here.

456
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:04,726
(tapping scratches)

457
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:06,905
And this is that same color.

458
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:08,987
Same, same color.

459
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,086
(tapping scratches)

460
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,532
There we go.

461
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,221
There we go.

462
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,853
And all you're looking for is distant,

463
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,052
distant indications here.

464
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,091
We don't want

465
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:26,472
We don't want a lot of detail yet.

466
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:27,672
When things are far away

467
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,072
you don't see all the detail that you see

468
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:31,571
when they're close up.

469
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:36,131
So, lack of detail sometimes
can be as important as detail.

470
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,151
Just let these little trees grow

471
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,350
wherever you think they should.

472
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,970
And don't worry about
covering up some of this

473
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,390
because it's gonna show through,

474
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,171
and that's what makes it look real.

475
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,789
Nature doesn't move trees just so it's

476
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,241
pretty for ya.

477
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,450
They grow wherever makes 'em happy.

478
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,330
(scratching taps)

479
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,289
Very quickly here we'll just drop in

480
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,729
some happy little things here.

481
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:04,250
Same color, same color.

482
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,932
That's all there is to it.

483
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:14,321
Same, same old color.

484
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,820
Very dark color.

485
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,761
Now, this fan brush has
a little white on it.

486
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:20,280
I wanna put some little indications maybe

487
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,539
a few little tree trunks back here.

488
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,940
So, all I'm doing is lifting upward.

489
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,240
Very lightly.

490
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,860
Very few. Don't get crazy.

491
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:29,361
Don't get too many here.

492
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,040
Just a few, just a few.

493
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,380
And if you get one that's too light,

494
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:35,301
all you have to do is rub it a little bit,

495
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,721
and it'll pick up that
dark color underneath,

496
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:39,040
and it'll go away.

497
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,181
Now then, let's put some highlight here.

498
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,261
I'm gonna start with

499
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:45,560
this is cadmium yellow.

500
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,141
Put a little yellow ochre into it.

501
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:49,500
And some sap green.

502
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,320
And we'll just mix these
right on the fan brush.

503
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,607
A lot of paint in the brush.

504
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,867
Lot of paint.

505
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:57,067
Just work that brush.

506
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,127
But, you can see all the layers of color.

507
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:00,987
And when you mix on the brush,

508
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:02,708
you get all these different layers.

509
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,608
You don't have one flat, old, dead color.

510
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:07,107
And we're looking for
a bright, shiny color.

511
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,388
Kay.

512
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:10,567
Now we touch and push

513
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,708
bend upward.

514
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,407
Just bend that brush upward.

515
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:15,028
Can you see how that's a

516
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,127
touch it, push it and bend it.

517
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:19,187
And that makes all those
little grassy things.

518
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,747
Way back here in the distance.

519
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,538
Far, far away.

520
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:27,627
Maybe there's, maybe, maybe
comes right down through.

521
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,886
Wherever you want it.

522
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:29,926
There it goes.

523
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,928
There it goes, right up through there.

524
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:36,168
(scratching taps)

525
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,287
Right on up

526
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:39,307
And you just sort of make
these little paintings

527
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:41,028
up in your mind as you go along.

528
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,288
Let 'em happen.

529
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:44,728
Now, I want some reflections on there.

530
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:45,748
So, I'm gonna touch

531
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:48,467
a small, small amount of the thalo blue.

532
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,648
I want the reflections to
have a little more blue

533
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,987
cast to 'em.

534
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:53,307
And go right up here and

535
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:54,927
I'm gonna pick up a
little bit of the color.

536
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,568
And it's gonna mix with the blue.

537
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,567
And all of it's gonna
mix with the Magic White.

538
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,587
And instant, instant reflections.

539
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:04,327
This may be one of the
most fantastic things

540
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:05,748
that happens in this technique.

541
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,888
Is some of the most
spectacular reflections

542
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,467
imaginable.

543
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:11,988
And it's easy.

544
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:13,169
So easy.

545
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,228
(scratching)

546
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:16,368
There we go.

547
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:19,108
And then, very lightly, go across.

548
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:21,907
This'll give it a watery appearance.

549
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:24,458
That easy.

550
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:26,757
Now then.

551
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,267
Maybe there's some stones back here.

552
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,768
So let's take some burnt umber.

553
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:31,448
And I'll use yellow ochre.

554
00:20:32,577 --> 00:20:34,127
Yellow ochre and burnt umber.

555
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,628
Put a little titanium white in there too.

556
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:37,867
What the heck.

557
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:40,067
That'll be our highlight color.

558
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:43,488
And then we can start with
just straight Van Dyke Brown.

559
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:45,728
And put in our base color.

560
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,728
We'll just drop in some
happy little things

561
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,407
♫ do doodle do do doo

562
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:51,546
♫ do doodle de do ♫

563
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:52,688
There you go.

564
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:54,008
Just let 'em happen.

565
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,288
And painting, painting
should make ya happy.

566
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,208
Should bring a song to your heart.

567
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:01,688
Make you appreciate life.

568
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:04,588
All the beautiful things that
are happening around you.

569
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,667
Take time to

570
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,207
Take time to look at nature,

571
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,628
to appreciate it.

572
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:11,278
Sometimes we

573
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:13,367
we look at it everyday and we

574
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,167
we have a tendency to overlook it.

575
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:17,848
Okay, this is that highlight color.

576
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:19,508
It's yellow ochre and burnt umber,

577
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:20,867
and a little titanium white.

578
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:23,788
See, and you get all these things

579
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:25,307
because you don't over mix your paint.

580
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:26,248
Let it

581
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:27,448
Let it happen.

582
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:28,668
Don't fight it.

583
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:31,008
That's what it's all about.

584
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:33,598
Just relax.

585
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:36,478
Be calm, peaceful.

586
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,097
And let it go.

587
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:40,868
Okay, now then

588
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,048
we'll take

589
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:43,587
and let's just drop in some

590
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,827
some little grassy areas coming
right down through there.

591
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,028
Wherever you want 'em.

592
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:50,417
Over here a few.

593
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,548
And that sort of just
ties it all together.

594
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:57,148
And now I'll use a little
of the Magic White.

595
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,207
Very thin.

596
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,788
And we'll drop in a happy
little water line back here.

597
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:03,877
Just like so.

598
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:04,967
(zipping)

599
00:22:05,218 --> 00:22:06,567
And the beauty of this,

600
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,009
the beauty of this technique

601
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:09,569
is that right in the middle of it

602
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,870
you can change your mind.

603
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:13,851
You can redesign paintings.

604
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,007
Because this is your world.

605
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,888
You can do anything that you
want to do in this world.

606
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,788
Anything that you wanna do.

607
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,408
(liquid swishing)

608
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:27,987
Wash that brush real quick.

609
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,507
Okay, a little of the Magic White.

610
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:32,108
A little titanium white.

611
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:34,087
Maybe, who knows, who knows.

612
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,747
Maybe back here there's just a

613
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:38,087
little indication.

614
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,027
There it is. Look at that.

615
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:40,987
Look at that.

616
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:42,167
A little stream lives right there.

617
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,406
And just, it drops right in here

618
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,167
and puts some water
right into our painting.

619
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:49,087
Right into our painting.

620
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,508
A few little happy, grassy things.

621
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:53,708
And that easy.

622
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,127
That easy.

623
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,327
You can just put you
a happy little stream.

624
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:59,567
Little foam here where it's

625
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,287
coming out into this river, lake or pond.

626
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:03,906
Whatever you want it to be.

627
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,488
Okay, now we can

628
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:08,126
we can get over here into the foreground

629
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:09,387
and really have some fun.

630
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,768
So, I'm gonna take all the
dark colors that I got.

631
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:13,406
There's brown, there's blue

632
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:16,807
oh there's some crimson,
big gob of sap green.

633
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:19,627
Big thing is that it's dark.

634
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:21,887
Kay, let me get a big brush here.

635
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:25,606
And I'll just use this old, dirty brush.

636
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:28,087
We'll go right up into this color.

637
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:29,327
Wiggle that brush.

638
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:30,968
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle that brush.

639
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:33,667
Bring it to a nice sharp, sharp edge.

640
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,168
See if you can see that. See.

641
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,766
It's a very nice, sharp, chiseled edge.

642
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,028
Let's go up here.

643
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:42,666
Now, right here, in my world, there lives

644
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:46,347
There certainly better live there now.

645
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:47,826
A big evergreen tree.

646
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,567
And he just lives right in this brush.

647
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,228
And all you do is just go back and forth.

648
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,037
And push him out.

649
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:56,617
Just push him out.

650
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,631
And there he comes.

651
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:01,370
There he comes.

652
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,009
Don't be afraid of this
brush because it's big.

653
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:06,070
It will do absolutely fantastic things.

654
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:09,390
And right here there's
a little bush and a tree

655
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,871
and it comes right across.

656
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:14,517
Wherever you want it.

657
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:17,728
We'll just fill all this up with dark.

658
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:18,647
You need the dark

659
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:20,347
in order for your light to show.

660
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,548
We can't have light without dark.

661
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:25,866
You know it's just like

662
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,008
it's just like in life.

663
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,846
You can't know happiness

664
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:30,887
unless you've known a
little bit of sorrow.

665
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:35,048
So, Good Lord gives us all
a little bit of sorrow,

666
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:39,186
so we can know the
happiness when it comes.

667
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,687
Tree trunks.

668
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,088
Little burnt umber.

669
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:44,207
♫ do do da do do to ♫

670
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,908
There we are.

671
00:24:45,907 --> 00:24:47,687
Little highlight color.

672
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,228
This is a little yellow ochre.

673
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:52,688
Kay, now then

674
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:54,528
I'm gonna take a

675
00:24:55,617 --> 00:24:56,387
one-inch brush

676
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:58,126
put a little paint thinner
on it to thin the paint.

677
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:00,326
Sap green and yellow.

678
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:02,326
And let's just very quickly here

679
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:04,248
drop in some little indications of

680
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:06,428
a few highlights.

681
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:08,088
Just a few indications.

682
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:10,867
Darker, darker, darker
as they go down here.

683
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:14,488
If your paint,

684
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:15,987
if you have trouble making it stick,

685
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:18,048
add a little bit of paint thinner

686
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,606
or Magic White, that'll thin your paint.

687
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,067
There we go.

688
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,607
Drop in a happy little bush right there.

689
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,447
This is sap green, cad yellow.

690
00:25:27,077 --> 00:25:28,586
Just drop 'em in, wherever you want 'em.

691
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:29,807
It's your world.

692
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:30,607
Tell you what

693
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:32,988
gonna add a small amount of indian yellow,

694
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:37,288
yellow ochre and some permanent red here.

695
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:38,267
I want one that

696
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:39,587
that shines right here.

697
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:41,747
Just like so.

698
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:46,347
And I really hope you've enjoyed this.

699
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:48,537
It's a lot of fun.

700
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:50,826
I hope to see ya every week here with us.

701
00:25:51,906 --> 00:25:54,287
And we'll teach you some
of the most fantastic

702
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,447
and easy paintings you've ever seen.

703
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:57,946
And they're very effective.

704
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:59,446
They'll make you happy (laugh)

705
00:25:59,446 --> 00:26:01,346
Your friends will never
believe you've done 'em.

706
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:07,408
Mkay, now with just a clean knife here,

707
00:26:07,407 --> 00:26:09,788
we can drop in a few
little sticks and twigs.

708
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:12,347
That easy. Wherever you
think they should be.

709
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:15,146
Just drop 'em in.

710
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:17,207
(tapping scraping)

711
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:20,247
And I think we have a finished painting.

712
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,387
And with that,

713
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:23,416
we'll stop here.

714
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,007
I'd like to wish each and every one of ya

715
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:25,948
happy painting.

716
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,327
I look forward to seeing you next week.

717
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,216
Good bye.
