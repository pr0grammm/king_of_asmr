1
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:02,838
- Hi, I'm Bob Ross,

2
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:05,237
and for the next 13
weeks, I'll be your host,

3
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:08,201
as we experience The Joy of Painting.

4
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:10,333
I think each of us,
sometime during our life,

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,423
has wanted to paint a picture.

6
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:13,625
I think there's an artist

7
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,722
hidden in the bottom of
every single one of us.

8
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:17,884
And here we will try to show you

9
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,773
how to bring that artist out,

10
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:21,600
to put it on canvas.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,107
Because you too, can
paint almighty pictures.

12
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,250
You know, we have avoided
painting for so long

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,521
because I think, all of
our lives, we've been told

14
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:32,167
that you have to go to
school half of your life,

15
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:35,859
maybe even have to be blessed
by Michelangelo at birth

16
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,161
to ever be able to paint a picture.

17
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,042
And here we want to show
you that that's not true.

18
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:44,893
That you can paint a
picture right along with us.

19
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:46,984
Each week we'll use the same colors,

20
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,893
we'll use the same equipment,

21
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:52,518
so if you have your brush
and pallet ready next week,

22
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,183
you can paint right along with us.

23
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:55,836
I'd like to go over some of the equipment

24
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:57,810
that we'll use before we start.

25
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,740
The brushes that we use.

26
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,194
I'll be using very large,
two and a half inch,

27
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:05,633
and one inch, natural bristle brushes.

28
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,591
Now these are natural bristle.

29
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:11,644
Be sure you don't start
with a nylon brush.

30
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:14,644
We'll use an almighty palette knife.

31
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:16,412
And this is much different

32
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:17,640
than the traditional palette knife.

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,149
It is not thin and flimsy,
it's a firm palette knife.

34
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,487
And with this we can make
fantastic things happen.

35
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:26,983
Let's go over the colors that we'll use.

36
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:30,695
We're gonna start out
here with Titanium white,

37
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:32,509
Phthalo green,

38
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,397
Prussian blue,

39
00:01:34,397 --> 00:01:36,221
Van Dyke brown,

40
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,204
Alizarin crimson,

41
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:39,037
Sap green,

42
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:40,954
Cad yellow,

43
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,962
and Permanent red.

44
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:46,612
Now these eight colors, we'll
use each and every week,

45
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,314
for every picture that we do.

46
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:49,188
So you don't have to go out

47
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:52,681
and buy 1500 different
kinds of colors and brushes.

48
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:56,049
You need very little
equipment to paint with this.

49
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,205
Another thing, we'll do no
tracing of patterns on here.

50
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,905
We start with the vision in our heart,

51
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,659
and we put it on canvas.

52
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,975
And we're here to teach you
to be able to do this too.

53
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:09,145
So, let's do it.

54
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,971
Let's paint a picture right here.

55
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,623
We're gonna to start with a big brush,

56
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,402
and were gonna cover the canvas

57
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,001
with a thin layer of magic white.

58
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,806
Now this is a wet-on-wet technique,

59
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,210
so the first thing were going
to do is get the canvas wet.

60
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,331
And all we want is a nice,
even coat of paint here.

61
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:28,331
There we go.

62
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,981
Just cover it nice and even.

63
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,532
You also need an almighty
easel when you're doing this.

64
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,511
You need an easel that will
hold your canvas very firm,

65
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,760
and allow you to use these big brushes.

66
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:45,460
Okay.

67
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:47,919
When you're using a large brush like this,

68
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,636
it really doesn't take too
long to cover your canvas.

69
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:54,121
And if you get a hair like that,

70
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,074
just pop it off with the
corner of your brush,

71
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:57,157
flip it away.

72
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,945
Okay.

73
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:03,627
Now after you get your canvas
covered with a magic white,

74
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,296
we'll take and make long
strokes back and forth

75
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:10,379
to get a nice even
distribution of paint on here.

76
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:12,715
Okay.

77
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,735
Up and down one time.

78
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:19,378
That assures that the magic white's

79
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:23,465
nice and even all the
way across the canvas.

80
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,560
Okay, let's wash the brush out here.

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,104
We wash our brushes with
odorless paint thinner.

82
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:32,271
Okay, we'll wash them out.

83
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:38,733
And I beat the brush
just to dry the bristles.

84
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:43,367
Now let's take a little
bit of Cad yellow here,

85
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,543
and I think today we'll
do a picture that's,

86
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,795
maybe like were walking through the woods.

87
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:48,700
And so let's start right here

88
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,775
with a little bit of Cad yellow,

89
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:55,405
with just the least little
touch of Phalo green in it.

90
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:58,169
And we'll out a little bit
more of the green color,

91
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:01,268
and we'll begin making little X's,

92
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,350
just like so.

93
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:07,197
Just work that around.

94
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:10,884
Okay.

95
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:13,572
Now without cleaning the brush,

96
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:15,908
we'll go right into some Prussian blue.

97
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,483
Just add it right onto the brush here.

98
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:20,812
We'll just go out here.

99
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:24,979
And were making the crisscross
strokes, little X strokes.

100
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:27,088
There.

101
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,670
Already we're beginning
to have a light source

102
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,087
in this painting.

103
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:45,216
Okay, now we'll clean the brush again.

104
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:46,935
Once again, this is
odorless paint thinner.

105
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:49,018
We do not use turpentine.

106
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,908
Now with a nice clean brush,

107
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:59,430
I'm gonna take and add just a
little bit of Titanium white,

108
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,514
right here in the center.

109
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,245
Just a little.

110
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:08,508
And we'll begin working outward.

111
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,342
There.

112
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,823
By now maybe you have recognized

113
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:15,596
some of the equipment we're using

114
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,738
as something you've seen before.

115
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:23,359
And I learned this fantastic
technique wonderful man

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,579
that I think all of us have enjoyed

117
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,691
for many many years on TV,

118
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,200
Bill Alexander.

119
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:31,866
And Bill taught me this many years ago.

120
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,414
It is the most fantastic way to paint

121
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:35,528
that you've ever seen.

122
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:36,445
So join us.

123
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:38,870
Have some fun.

124
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,036
And we'll just blend this
out a little bit more here.

125
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:49,843
Until we have a nice blue sky.

126
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:52,579
There we go.

127
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:03,822
Okay, we'll clean the brush one more time.

128
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,547
Now let's start putting in
some almighty trees here.

129
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:15,196
We're gonna start with a
little bit of Alizarin crimson,

130
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:17,539
and a touch of Prussian blue.

131
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:20,319
Now the Prussian blue is
100 times stronger than

132
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,486
the Crimson, so use just a
little blue and a lot of Crimson.

133
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,744
And here we're going to begin
pushing in basic tree shapes.

134
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:31,661
So just bend the brush.

135
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,711
Bend the brush.

136
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,698
Make those little leaves and branches

137
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:38,436
just pop right out at you.

138
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:39,687
There he comes.

139
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:43,266
These little son of a
guns hide in your brush

140
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:46,182
and you just have to push them out.

141
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,343
This is your world, your creation.

142
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:54,176
Let's put a little one right here.

143
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,636
And maybe we'll just put
some little grassy areas

144
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:02,719
coming down through here.

145
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,730
And right there, there is one.

146
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,677
You're pushing quite firm here.

147
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:16,495
This is why I say you
need an almighty easel

148
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:20,809
when you're doing this,
an easel that's strong.

149
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:21,642
Okay.

150
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,362
Maybe over here on this side now,

151
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:28,399
we'll add another one.

152
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,815
Maybe a bigger one over here.

153
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:35,607
There he is.

154
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:41,915
And there's no secret to
this, anybody can paint.

155
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:43,144
Anybody can paint.

156
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:47,311
All you need is a dream in
your heart, a little practice.

157
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:53,396
There, already we have the
beginning of a beautiful picture.

158
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:57,603
We have the tree shapes, the light source.

159
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:01,186
Looks to me like it's
early in the morning.

160
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,134
Okay.

161
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:10,514
Now, let's put some trunks on these trees.

162
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:15,439
And for that will take a
little bit of Van Dyke brown,

163
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,189
and let's just lay in
some basic trunks here.

164
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:21,117
There we go.

165
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:28,520
And maybe we'll put a little
limb right here, like so.

166
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,901
Maybe a little something right there.

167
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:35,985
There we are.

168
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:39,618
Okay, now this little fellow over here,

169
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,368
he needs a trunk too.

170
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:44,978
So we'll put one right in here.

171
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:53,382
And maybe some limbs up in here.

172
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,452
Right through here, there we go.

173
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,366
Just some indications here and there,

174
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:03,116
and some little sticks and twigs.

175
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:06,783
Maybe over here.

176
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:09,490
There we are.

177
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,959
Okay.

178
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,151
Now we'll highlight these,

179
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,722
and we'll take a little bit of white,

180
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:22,722
and a touch of brown mixed together.

181
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:26,404
And remember where your light source is.

182
00:09:26,404 --> 00:09:29,822
So this tree, we'll highlight right here.

183
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:34,086
Like so.

184
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,214
There we are.

185
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,454
Now over on this side,

186
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:44,362
the light's coming through here,

187
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:47,280
so we'll highlight this side of it.

188
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:55,144
Maybe a few little
indications up through here.

189
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:58,692
Now comes the fun.

190
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,490
Now we can begin putting
all the beautiful leaves

191
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,663
and stuff on this, and just
really make it come alive.

192
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:09,927
So here, we'll take a little
bit of the magic white,

193
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,298
to thin our paint.

194
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:12,769
One of the golden rules in this,

195
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,122
this is a thin paint, we'll
stick to a thick paint.

196
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:18,184
So anytime you're painting
over the top of paint,

197
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:22,689
you need to have a paint that's
just a little bit thinner.

198
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,857
We'll take a little bit of Phalo green

199
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,778
and a little bit of yellow,

200
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:33,658
and we load the brush full of paint.

201
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:34,903
And out light's coming through here,

202
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:36,554
so we want the side of the tree

203
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:39,373
to be a little brighter
than the other side.

204
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:40,629
All right.

205
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:42,032
And then we begin pushing

206
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,949
thousands of little leaves on here.

207
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:48,771
They hide in your brush.

208
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,105
There they come.

209
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:55,068
Just a little on this side over here,

210
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,298
because not as much light's gonna strike.

211
00:10:57,298 --> 00:11:00,716
A little's come through, but not as much.

212
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:08,567
And look at that.

213
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,769
In just a matter of a few minutes,

214
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,852
we have a beautiful tree.

215
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,375
Now maybe, this little tree over here,

216
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,375
we'll put a little highlight on him.

217
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:20,918
And once again, we're using a paint

218
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:24,835
that's a little bit
thinner, so that it sticks.

219
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:31,020
First thing that you have
to do when you're doing this

220
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,926
is start with an oil paint
that's very, very firm.

221
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,639
Your base paint has to be extremely firm.

222
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,109
If you start with a thin, loose paint,

223
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:43,014
your gonna become a mud mixer.

224
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:46,548
You have to have a thick
paint on the base coat

225
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,582
in order to get this
thinner paint to stick.

226
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,750
Now let's begin building some
bushes and stuff in here.

227
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,467
All right, look at that.

228
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,967
You can do it, I know you can.

229
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:03,432
There, look there.

230
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,668
Okay let's move to this
big tree in the front here

231
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,835
and let's put some nice
little leaves up here on him.

232
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:22,528
You have to bend that brush.

233
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:24,897
If the brush doesn't bend,
you're not gonna get all these

234
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:29,064
beautiful little leaves, these
little actions that happen.

235
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,495
Okay, maybe there's a nice little bush

236
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:38,328
that lives right here.

237
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,769
You know if you've ever
walked through the woods

238
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,534
early in the morning, all the
little creatures are out here.

239
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:47,427
They're all playing in
the bushes and stuff.

240
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:49,181
This is where they live.

241
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,848
In all these bushes.

242
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,899
Okay, let's put something
on this side now.

243
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,731
Nice little bush here.

244
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:04,425
Just let your imagination run wild.

245
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:06,843
Let your heart be your guide.

246
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:11,222
In the time you sit
around worrying about it,

247
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:12,732
trying to plan out painting,

248
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:15,574
you could have completed
a painting already.

249
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,992
Let it happen, let it happen.

250
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:26,538
You know for so many years
I was a traditional painter,

251
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:32,099
and I would spend sometimes
weeks just working on a picture,

252
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,697
drawing it out, getting all
the little sketches and stuff.

253
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,836
And then I'd go back
and spend maybe a month

254
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:39,241
trying to fill in the blocks.

255
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,276
And here, we let it happen.

256
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:43,530
It comes right out of here, it's in you.

257
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,595
And you put it on the canvas.

258
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:47,927
Okay, let's see.

259
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,616
Let's try this big ole tree here,

260
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:58,616
put some nice little leaves on him.

261
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:04,308
There we go.

262
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,433
Yeah.

263
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:17,690
Mmm.

264
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:27,456
Okay, let's try, I've added
a little permanent red with

265
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:31,624
my color now, just to give
us a little different value.

266
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:39,059
Okay, and you know if we're
going to walk through the woods,

267
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:41,645
we need a little path.

268
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:45,812
So let's take a little bit
of Van Dyke brown here,

269
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,644
and let's build us a happy little path.

270
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,960
We're just gonna take the
knife and let this path

271
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,627
sort of just wander
right down through here.

272
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,857
There we go, just let it wander
'round, play and have fun.

273
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:19,913
Okay, there we got us a nice little path.

274
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,216
Now we need to highlight
that path so I'll take

275
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:25,466
just a little bit of white,

276
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:30,866
and we'll just take it and
barely touch the canvas here.

277
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,831
Just enough so we can highlight

278
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,081
where the sun's sparkling through here.

279
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,620
There, see how easy that is?

280
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,250
Let the paint break.

281
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:53,364
And now in order to set the
path down into the painting,

282
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:55,913
we'll add some bushes that
project up over the path

283
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,163
here and there.

284
00:15:58,636 --> 00:15:59,636
Push 'em in.

285
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,259
There we go.

286
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,599
And you can see how that
makes it literally drop

287
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,599
right into the painting.

288
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:19,631
Okay, let's put some
more land aries in here.

289
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:26,653
Maybe this nice little area's
coming down through here.

290
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,909
Just like so.

291
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:46,105
Maybe we'll have some over here.

292
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,605
Follow the angle of your land.

293
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:54,326
There we go, there we go.

294
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:08,045
There, now maybe, maybe, maybe,

295
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:11,759
as we're walking through the woods here,

296
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,009
maybe it rained last night.

297
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,724
Maybe it came a nice little rain.

298
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:19,641
There's little puddles.

299
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:23,791
You know after it rains you
always have little rain puddles.

300
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,428
So let's take a little touch
of the Prussian blue here,

301
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:29,027
and we'll just make us a little puddle.

302
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,279
And we put some Prussian
blue on the brush,

303
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,196
and we take here and pull downward.

304
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:37,407
Just pull downward like so.

305
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:43,031
There we go.

306
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,273
Okay, see how easy it is to do?

307
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:53,264
Now.

308
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:57,625
Very gently, we'll come across this way.

309
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,291
Just to give it a watery effect.

310
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:04,477
Now if you want to, if you
wanna put highlights in here,

311
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:06,179
maybe you could take just a little touch

312
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,346
of the Titanium white on
your brush, and pull down.

313
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:14,144
It'll give it sort of a sheen.

314
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:24,913
There and then once again
just come across just enough

315
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,390
to give it a nice watery feel.

316
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,557
You can overdo this part very easily.

317
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:36,973
Okay, wash off the ole brush.

318
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,206
Okay, now we can take a little
more of the Van Dyke brown

319
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:54,668
and we can just make
little puddles out of this.

320
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:58,752
Maybe it comes down like
so, right through there.

321
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:01,444
There we are.

322
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,958
Okay, little puddle.

323
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:12,951
And we just make this a little
separate puddle back here.

324
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,372
Just like that.

325
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:27,421
Okay, now we take a little
bit of brown and white,

326
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:30,726
and we'll lay a little highlight on there.

327
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:31,726
There we go.

328
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,869
And in your world, you can do anything

329
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:45,868
that your heart desires.

330
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,786
My home is in Fairbanks, Alaska,
and I spend a lot of time

331
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,972
walking around the woods
and talking to trees

332
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:01,724
and squirrels and little
rabbits and stuff.

333
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:03,977
And I look at a lot of nature.

334
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:06,551
And if painting teaches you
nothing else, it'll teach you

335
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,250
to look at nature with different eyes.

336
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,889
It'll teach you to see
things that have been there

337
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,103
all your life, and you've never noticed.

338
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:18,775
And if it does nothing else
but make you enjoy nature,

339
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,186
it's worthwhile.

340
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,766
So look around, look at what we have.

341
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,517
Beauty is everywhere.

342
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,694
You only have to look to see it.

343
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,777
Okay, I talk too much sometimes

344
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:33,164
so we'll go back to painting here.

345
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:35,507
Take a little bit of the
thin white paint here,

346
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:38,349
and we'll put some little
water lines back in here.

347
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:39,932
Okay, just like so.

348
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:43,917
There we go.

349
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:53,472
There, and maybe some little
water lines right here.

350
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,146
This is just a thin white paint
and you literally just cut

351
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:03,013
right into the canvas with it.

352
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,180
And let's smooth that out.

353
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:07,329
There we go.

354
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,413
Okay, now while I have the
knife here, I'm gonna take it

355
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:20,461
and just cut a few little
sticks here and there.

356
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:22,355
And all we're doing is
just literally cutting

357
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,355
right through the paint.

358
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,653
So the canvas shows through and it makes

359
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,069
a multitude of little sticks,

360
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,929
and these little sticks
help create the illusion

361
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,096
of distance in a painting.

362
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,406
All different planes.

363
00:21:46,818 --> 00:21:50,735
Okay, now then, let's
put some bushes and stuff

364
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,993
right down here on the
grass, on this soil area.

365
00:21:57,993 --> 00:21:58,993
There we go.

366
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,990
There they are, there they are.

367
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,679
They just live right here in your brush.

368
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,262
And you just drop 'em right in.

369
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:15,240
There.

370
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:22,413
Okay, now let's take and do this.

371
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:29,250
Let's put some land
right down through here.

372
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,250
Back to the Van Dyke
brown, little bit of white.

373
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:36,436
There we go.

374
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:43,179
We'll add a little highlight on here.

375
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:46,945
There.

376
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:56,077
And we'll put a few little
bushes and stuff right out here.

377
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:01,776
See how easy that is?

378
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:06,553
Okay, a few more little
water lines in there.

379
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:11,100
Just let 'em happen.

380
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:16,933
Each week, we'll try to do
paintings that are designed

381
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:19,801
to teach you something
different, something new,

382
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:21,384
something exciting.

383
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:24,871
Just to keep your interest going.

384
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:28,038
Okay now let's play a little bit here.

385
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:32,486
Let's have a happy little
tree right in here.

386
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:35,097
So we'll start with the Van
Dyke brown, and we'll make

387
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:37,481
his little trunk here.

388
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:38,648
There he goes.

389
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:46,225
Straight Van Dyke brown to start with.

390
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:49,997
There and we just turn him
out to give him little foots

391
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:50,997
to stand on.

392
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:54,286
There.

393
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,728
And maybe he needs another
little arm out here.

394
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:04,413
So we'll just give him one.

395
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,641
This is your creation,
you can do anything here

396
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:08,307
that you want to do.

397
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:12,998
Just let it happen.

398
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:16,958
There.

399
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,989
Now, and we'll give
him some little leaves,

400
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:25,466
and we'll use some more
of the Alizarin crimson,

401
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,548
a touch of Prussian blue.

402
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:31,385
Okay, and we need dark
in order to show light.

403
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:34,598
So first we'll put some dark on here.

404
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,682
I'll put some happy little
leaves here and there.

405
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:43,455
When we see you next
week I hope you have your

406
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:47,462
almighty easels set up, the colors ready,

407
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:50,893
your big brushes all
primed and ready to go,

408
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:54,309
and do an almighty painting with us here.

409
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:58,137
Very quickly while I'm
finishing this up I'll go over

410
00:24:58,137 --> 00:25:01,172
the colors, one more time, that we use.

411
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:04,922
Titanium white, Phthalo
green, Prussian blue,

412
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:11,740
Van Dyke brown, Alizarin
crimson, Sap green,

413
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:17,595
Cad yellow, and Permanent red.

414
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,981
Only eight colors that you need.

415
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:24,998
Okay now let's put some highlights

416
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:28,646
on this pretty little tree right here.

417
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:32,086
Mmm, I used just a little
touch more of the Permanent red

418
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:35,836
on this one so he'll
stand out a little more.

419
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,222
See how easy it is to create a tree

420
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:41,306
right here in your world?

421
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:43,994
There we go.

422
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:54,288
And maybe down here, maybe
there's some nice little

423
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:57,603
bushes and stuff happening right in here.

424
00:25:57,603 --> 00:25:58,603
There we go.

425
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,470
All right, maybe right there another one.

426
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,593
Okay, here and there I'm gonna put

427
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:14,509
just a few little sticks and stuff.

428
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:16,298
Like that.

429
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:23,206
Just, once again, to build
some distance in here.

430
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,036
We want this to have a lot of depth in it.

431
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,456
Maybe we'll cut in a few
little sticks here and there,

432
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:30,288
like so.

433
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,576
You gettin' excited yet?

434
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:39,046
You ready to paint with us?

435
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:40,212
You can do it.

436
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:51,955
Okay, and I think this
painting's far enough along,

437
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,851
we'll just sign this rascal.

438
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:59,910
And I sign the painting
with a script liner brush,

439
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,090
a little bit of oil, and I
use red paint, but whatever

440
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,506
color you prefer.

441
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:10,020
Okay, and we'll just sign that rascal.

442
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,631
I hope you've enjoyed this painting.

443
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:20,422
Next week we're looking
forward to seeing you.

444
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,956
I hope you have your brush ready.

445
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:26,718
A dream in your heart that
you want to put on canvas.

446
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:30,789
And join us, right here,
at The Joy of Painting,

447
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:34,206
and you too can build fantastic pictures.

448
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:38,840
You can take 'em from
here, and put 'em on there.

449
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,007
Until next week, happy
painting, from all of us here.

450
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,490
