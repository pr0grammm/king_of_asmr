1
00:00:00,592 --> 00:00:02,145
- Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:04,192
Today I'd thought we'd do
a little picture that's

3
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,244
little different than
what we've been doing.

4
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:09,777
And today I wanna emphasize
how to do several ranges

5
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,493
of mountains and have
some in the background

6
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:15,150
that are very quiet, and very
distant and then come forward

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,390
with it and let's see what happens here.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,016
I've already prepared
the canvas with a layer

9
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:23,520
of magic white, just
brushed in both directions.

10
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:27,266
Okay, we'll start with a
little bit of Persian blue

11
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:31,014
and we're really working to
the bristles of the brush.

12
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:33,682
And we'll start right at the top

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,947
working across

14
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:40,768
and we're picking up the magic
white as we go across here

15
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:43,867
and automatically it
makes the sky get lighter

16
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:46,381
as it works downward.

17
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,937
We don't want a sky that

18
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:50,524
just looks like you
pulled the curtain down.

19
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:52,856
We're trying to avoid those.

20
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:59,273
Okay, let me real
hypnotize it a little bit.

21
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:01,484
Okay.

22
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:06,000
And while we've got some
blue on the brush here,

23
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:09,156
we might as well go ahead and

24
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,989
put in a little bit of water here.

25
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,838
This is still the Persian blue.

26
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:22,608
And we'll just hypnotize
this a little bit,

27
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,441
bring it all together.

28
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:27,519
Anyway it doesn't matter where
you get your waterline here

29
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,524
because when you put
all the other stuff in,

30
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,299
you can bring it to
whatever points you want it

31
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,299
so don't worry about it.

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,283
Okay.

33
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:42,480
We will wash this old brush.

34
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:49,774
Alrighty, let's take some blue

35
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,856
and a little bit of brown

36
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,281
and little bit of white

37
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:01,971
just to make a gray color, blue gray here.

38
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:05,118
And maybe we're gonna have
this mountain come way up

39
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,223
on the canvas, what the heck.

40
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:10,556
And just let it roll around.

41
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,269
We're gonna have a little bump right there

42
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,822
and let it wander right on off.

43
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:21,741
Very little paint and
we're pushing that paint

44
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:26,036
right into the canvas,
just really push it.

45
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:27,895
And we'll put a little bump right there,

46
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:29,562
another little hill.

47
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:38,252
Okay, now we'll take and
pull that paint down.

48
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:40,589
We want it to get lighter as it goes

49
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,942
toward the horizon here.

50
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:43,980
So we pull it down.

51
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,384
Once again it's mixing
with the magic white

52
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:50,551
that's already on the canvas
and automatically this occurs.

53
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,766
Pull this one down a little.

54
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:57,602
Okay.

55
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:00,750
Like so.

56
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,129
Now this time we want very little paint,

57
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:05,578
very little paint.

58
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:09,745
All we wanna do is give
little indications back here.

59
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:12,290
Just a little,

60
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:15,771
few little highlights.

61
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,144
Light plane right through here.

62
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,152
And you'll find if you're right handed,

63
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:29,853
it's normally easier to have the light

64
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:32,063
coming from the right.

65
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:35,251
If you're left handed it will
vary from person to person.

66
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:39,169
So you have to find what's
comfortable for you,

67
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:44,266
and maybe a little spec of
light back here on that point.

68
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:56,243
Okay, maybe we'll just let
these two work their way

69
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:57,411
together here.

70
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:05,138
Just make an almighty ridge
coming right through there.

71
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,258
There we go.

72
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:18,132
Now, for the shadow we'll
use a little blue and white,

73
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,490
little touch of brown with it.

74
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,743
Let's put a little shadow right here.

75
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:27,049
Don't want a great deal
in the shadows this time,

76
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:28,548
just a little bit.

77
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,592
Maybe a little touch over in here.

78
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:48,082
Few little things happening
all along the way.

79
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:03,038
Little bit too straight so I'm
gonna break that up a little

80
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,985
so it doesn't look too round.

81
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:10,151
Don't want it to look
phony, want it to look real.

82
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:14,135
Okay now I'm gonna
really diffuse this one.

83
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:16,969
I want it to just about disappear.

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,047
Even gonna work a little bit in there,

85
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,558
and we'll lift upward.

86
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:35,789
Always follow the angles that
you've built in your mountain.

87
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,290
Always work with those angles.

88
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:52,871
Okay now let's build
another one, little closer.

89
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:56,364
This time I'm gonna put
a little Alizarin in blue

90
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:58,751
to give it a little
bit more of a purplish,

91
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:01,502
little touch of brown to dull it.

92
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:05,736
All right.

93
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:11,611
And let's take this one and
run right up through here.

94
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:17,140
Now this being so dark
should push everything back.

95
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:24,962
Maybe a little bump there.

96
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:29,129
Want this just to be a nice
slow lowling a little hill.

97
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,982
And just get in there and
do it, thing like that.

98
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,731
Don't worry about it, let it happen.

99
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,564
There.

100
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,950
And we'll pull this down a little bit.

101
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,507
One reason we do so many
mountains in this series

102
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:00,121
is to teach you to use the knife

103
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:02,040
that you can make mountains,

104
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,247
you've made friends with the knife

105
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:08,165
then you can do just about
anything you wanna do with it.

106
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:12,331
Okay, maybe we'll take a
little blue and white here.

107
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,870
Maybe there's a few little
patches of snow laying on this

108
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,537
just here and there.

109
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:25,603
Just let those work down here and there.

110
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:28,588
There.

111
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:34,144
And maybe there's a little snow land

112
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:36,144
right in here somewhere.

113
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,024
Just sort of bring that together.

114
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:27,851
Okay and we'll take a little
bit of the blue and brown

115
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,852
and put some sap green with it.

116
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,647
There we go, very dark,
it should look black.

117
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:53,942
And now we'll load the brush up.

118
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:03,142
And let's just do some
little things like this.

119
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,096
I want some little indication of trees

120
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:08,013
way back in the distance back here.

121
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:28,827
And maybe a few of them have
just a little bit more detail

122
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:31,798
so we can just add a
little bit here and there.

123
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:34,096
We're only looking for
basic shapes as far back.

124
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:37,513
You would not see a great deal of detail.

125
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,793
And here and there nice little trees.

126
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,793
Add a little more shape.

127
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:57,809
Okay.

128
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:03,831
A lot of paint on the
brush, very, very thick.

129
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:38,841
Just like so.

130
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:43,593
Okay, now then we can take

131
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:47,761
and just scratch a few
little trunks here and there.

132
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,264
And all we're doing here is
using the point of the knife

133
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:56,691
and cutting through the
paint so the canvas shows.

134
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:59,163
And it gives the illusion of little trunks

135
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:01,246
way back in the distance.

136
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:08,647
And you don't have to worry
about cutting through the canvas

137
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:09,931
with this knife.

138
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:12,045
The canvas is very, very strong

139
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,815
and we recommend that
you use stretch canvas

140
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,185
rather than canvas boards.

141
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:18,375
The canvas boards have
cardboard in the center

142
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,701
and they have a tendency
to absorb your magic white

143
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:25,244
very rapidly and leave
you with a dry canvas.

144
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:26,822
And we depend on this being wet

145
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:29,734
through the whole picture.

146
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,401
Okay, now let's take

147
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,250
little gray,

148
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,267
a little yellow and red
all mixed together here

149
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:43,718
and let's start putting some
land coming down through here.

150
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:46,717
And all we're gonna do is just push.

151
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:51,507
Like so.

152
00:11:57,297 --> 00:12:00,964
All the little grassy
things happening here.

153
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,469
And maybe here and there we can see little

154
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,221
parts of the dirt showing through,

155
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:25,518
little areas where there's
some ground showing.

156
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,435
So we just lay that in.

157
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:33,754
And then you can just
go back and push it down

158
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,353
into the picture, put things
that are projecting over it.

159
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:40,766
Little more magic here,

160
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:44,934
have to have a thin paint to
make it stick on all these.

161
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,711
And as these come out of the shadow,

162
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:56,236
let them get a little brighter.

163
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,240
These trees with shadow all back in there.

164
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,407
So you want this to get a
little brighter as it comes out.

165
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,695
There we go.

166
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:12,219
And let's take and pull just
a little bit of this down

167
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:13,469
into the water.

168
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:31,361
There we go.

169
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:38,230
And then we'll just, just
hypnotize it a little bit,

170
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,480
just make it come together.

171
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,117
Here I'm adding just a little bit of dark.

172
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:50,621
We have two light areas so we'll
put a touch of dark in here

173
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,538
just to separate these,

174
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:56,153
very, very little paint.

175
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:09,472
Okay, now let's take
a little Vandyke brown

176
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,456
and we'll just go right along here and

177
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:18,085
build me some little shore.

178
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:21,752
Here all we're doing
is touching the canvas.

179
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:35,686
Okay, and we can put a
few little sticks in here

180
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:38,853
while we have some color on the knife.

181
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,121
You know what, when people
see all these little

182
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:49,709
sticks and stuff, they think
you've spent days and days

183
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,614
with your one haired brush sitting here

184
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,392
doing all these little rascals,

185
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,244
and when you get them believing that

186
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,576
then you up the price of it.

187
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,901
For a long time I've painted
this way in the secrecy

188
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:08,028
of my home and charged unbelievable prices

189
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:11,195
which a lot of painters are doing now.

190
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,969
But if people see it takes you 30 minutes

191
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:19,624
then they don't wanna pay you
an unbelievable price for it.

192
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:22,552
They wanna pay you 30 minutes labor, so

193
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:24,986
you have to make a decision
whether you wanna be a

194
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:29,153
traditional artist or an
artist that eats regular.

195
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:40,627
And we'll lay some little
ripples along the water here,

196
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:42,295
just here and there.

197
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,219
Okay, now

198
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:00,961
maybe we'll take some of this dark color

199
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,447
and let's put a little tree
right here, what the heck.

200
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,074
Like so.

201
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:21,501
And we'll take and pull
some of that paint down,

202
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,834
make this little reflection.

203
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,457
Put a little tree trunk in.

204
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:41,179
And we'll lay a little
highlight right along here

205
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:43,011
just so it stands out.

206
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,403
And then we need some leaves on it

207
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:53,571
so I'm gonna drop a few
little leaves here and there.

208
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
There we go.

209
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,312
Very light touch,

210
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:32,146
don't want to destroy.

211
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:41,801
And we'll use just a little
bit of the Vandyke here.

212
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:57,486
Okay,

213
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:02,142
now let's put something in the foreground.

214
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:05,864
We will have all kind of
nice little bushes and stuff

215
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,947
just growing around here.

216
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,596
And let's put something right here.

217
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,637
There we go.

218
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:40,740
And we'll highlight these real quick.

219
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:06,179
Look at that, all those
little leaves and bushes

220
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,227
and you can do it.

221
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,060
You can do it,

222
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,633
just practice a little,

223
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:14,069
load a lot of paint to the brush.

224
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,736
Remember thin paints
stick to a thick paint.

225
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:38,276
Maybe just a little greenery on this.

226
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,715
A little something right there.

227
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:58,754
Okay, a few little sticks.

228
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:23,442
Now let's get brave.

229
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,840
Let's have a huge limb coming out here

230
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,669
like there's a three over here somewhere

231
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,639
and all you can see is
a big limb coming out.

232
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:37,286
I know this is scary to

233
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:38,919
take in and put something like this

234
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:41,701
right out through all
the work you went through

235
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,951
but give it a try one time.

236
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:50,138
And maybe we have one
coming down through here.

237
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:03,213
And then we can have some
little limbs coming off these,

238
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:16,222
all kinds of little things happening here.

239
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:19,639
Wherever you want them just drop them in.

240
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:25,819
And there's a little something

241
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,319
just protruding right up here.

242
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:32,151
Okay, now

243
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:39,000
you could put just a little
bit of highlight on here

244
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,666
just to break it up.

245
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,802
Shows a little sunlight is hitting.

246
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:49,175
Yeah.

247
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,958
Now let's lay some leaves on top of them

248
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,334
and we first need some dark,

249
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:07,978
let me get some dark color here.

250
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:12,144
A little bit of sap, a
little bit of blue and brown.

251
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:14,191
There we go.

252
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:19,877
And we'd lay a little
color on the brush here

253
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:23,272
and now we're just gonna start tapping

254
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:26,939
where we want some nice
little leaves to be.

255
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:33,675
Just let them fall in there.

256
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,014
There.

257
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,221
Just sort of helps make a nice
composition of your picture

258
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,304
and push everything back.

259
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:54,925
Think you'll like this once you try it.

260
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:03,357
And as I say first time is sort of the

261
00:23:03,357 --> 00:23:05,038
son of a gun distance
through all these right up

262
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:05,992
in the middle of your picture.

263
00:23:05,992 --> 00:23:07,971
It's gonna scare you a little bit.

264
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,390
But jump in there and do it.

265
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,747
Remember you're the master.

266
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,359
This canvas is afraid of you.

267
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:15,858
You're the master.

268
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:23,953
Okay, now we can take

269
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,673
a lighter color green,

270
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,934
a little more magic in it.

271
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:36,127
And we'll load this brush full

272
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:38,375
and think where your light is coming from.

273
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,615
The top of these are
gonna be a little brighter

274
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:43,173
than the bottom so we'll just
lay a little bit of color

275
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,257
right along the top here.

276
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,459
This is where you need
a good brush though.

277
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:55,432
Be very careful about the brush you use.

278
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:58,857
Avoid nylon brushes, they cut paint.

279
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:01,691
These are natural bristle brushes.

280
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,653
Put the color right in here.

281
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:25,375
I always remember back when
I was a traditional painter

282
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,858
how long I would agonize trying
to do something like this

283
00:24:27,858 --> 00:24:30,702
with the little one haired brush

284
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,412
and working for days and days and days

285
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:36,495
to get an effect that you
can now get in minutes.

286
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:48,180
Okay.

287
00:24:57,156 --> 00:24:58,156
There we go,

288
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:01,769
and we have almighty limbs projecting

289
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,183
right out in our picture

290
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:06,122
and makes it look like
there's a tree over here.

291
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:07,122
Okay, maybe,

292
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,009
maybe right in here.

293
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,488
Let's do this.

294
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:15,643
Let's have an old tree that's falling over

295
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:17,950
coming right up through here.

296
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,472
If you got all your nerve
up and done this one,

297
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:25,136
shoot, we might as well
just keep going with it.

298
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:27,470
No use letting you stop now.

299
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:38,442
And maybe he had a little
friend that fell over with him.

300
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:42,757
There we go.

301
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:46,159
Now don't laugh, trees need friends too.

302
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,159
Everybody needs friends.

303
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:52,651
Okay.

304
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:59,256
Take a little white and little brown here.

305
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,264
Now you'll put just a
least little touch of

306
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:06,848
sort of an orangey color in it.

307
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:10,629
And we're gonna just
work that right down here

308
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:13,295
and make him look old and tired,

309
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:16,007
just barely touching.

310
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:22,018
Just pull that right along

311
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:24,128
like so.

312
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,961
Let it go.

313
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:29,480
Okay, now we'll take

314
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:34,213
and put a few little bushes in front

315
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:37,985
so he has a place for his foot to sit.

316
00:26:37,986 --> 00:26:39,956
And we'll take the liner brush,

317
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:42,705
a little bit of thin oil like so.

318
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:44,686
There we go.

319
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,355
And we'll put a few little
limbs hanging on here

320
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:52,117
that are just about going,

321
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:53,784
just here and there.

322
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:59,255
Let them go wherever which
way, whatever makes them happy.

323
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,997
And maybe this one is just hanging down.

324
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:06,913
He's tired,

325
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,126
poor old thing.

326
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:13,321
There.

327
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,989
This old tree is just about going,

328
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:21,155
it's gonna fall over here in the pond.

329
00:27:24,465 --> 00:27:27,798
Maybe a little limb or two left up here,

330
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:33,095
something like so.

331
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,349
Okay, I think we'll sign that one

332
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:44,824
and call it finished

333
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:46,158
and there we go.

334
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:49,160
And I'd like to thank you very, very much

335
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,968
for watching us today.

336
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,813
I hope you've enjoyed this painting

337
00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:54,769
and that you've painted along with us

338
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:56,676
and until next time, happy painting.

339
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,157
Thank you very, very much.

340
00:27:58,157 --> 00:28:00,740
(lively music)

341
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:06,153
(calm music)
