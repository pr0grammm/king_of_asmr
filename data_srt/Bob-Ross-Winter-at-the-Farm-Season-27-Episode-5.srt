1
00:00:03,197 --> 00:00:06,476
(light music)

2
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:32,188
- Welcome back.

3
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:33,767
Certainly glad to see you today.

4
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,388
I thought today we'd do
a painting that's just,

5
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,967
it's a lot of fun, very simple,

6
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:38,545
and I think you'll enjoy it.

7
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:39,941
So let's start out and have them

8
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:41,413
run all the colors across the screen

9
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:43,652
that you need to paint
this with me at home.

10
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:44,719
While they're doing that,

11
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,938
let me show you what I
got going up here today.

12
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:48,432
I have my standard old,

13
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,329
well, I'm using an 18 by 24 inch canvas,

14
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,570
but you use any size that you like

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,023
and all I've done is
covered the entire canvas

16
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:57,540
with a very, very...

17
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,012
Let me say it one more time.

18
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,128
A very thin coat of liquid clear.

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,034
Now, the clear's on here
just to make the canvas

20
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:04,825
wet and slick

21
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:06,638
and that's really the
only reason it's there.

22
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:08,537
Be careful when you're using this clear

23
00:01:08,537 --> 00:01:10,117
because you can't see it up here hardly.

24
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:11,139
It's hard to,

25
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,399
it's hard to tell if you have enough.

26
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,382
If you have any doubt...

27
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:16,432
Because usually, you put too much on.

28
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:17,327
If you have any doubt,

29
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:19,268
take a paper towel and wipe it down.

30
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:21,316
What's left will be just right.

31
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:22,382
It's better to have too litte

32
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,534
than it is to have too much.

33
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:25,667
You just wanna make the
paint slide on there.

34
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,540
Let's have fun today.

35
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,503
The old two-inch brush.

36
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:32,936
And I'm gonna use very, very little color.

37
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:35,902
Pull the smallest little amount,

38
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:38,420
smallest little amount

39
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,085
of the blue out here.

40
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:42,887
Little, tiny bit of blue.

41
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:44,536
Very small amount.

42
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,029
Let's go up in here.

43
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:47,009
Now,

44
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,929
very gently

45
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:48,993
I'm just going to begin

46
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:51,554
applying some color up here in the sky.

47
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:52,230
I want the...

48
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,686
Let's do a winter scene today.

49
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:55,603
So,

50
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:56,967
let's make it very soft,

51
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,520
very misty.

52
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,510
One of those winter...

53
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,618
Tell you what,

54
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:03,833
let's get crazy.

55
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,603
Let's get crazy today.

56
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,426
Let's have a...

57
00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:09,545
Maybe a few little buildings down here

58
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:11,422
like a little farm scene or something.

59
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,426
I don't know.

60
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:14,155
Just sort of do it and see what happens.

61
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:15,818
It doesn't matter

62
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:17,182
because as you know,

63
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:19,737
in our world, we don't make mistakes.

64
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:22,528
We just have happy accidents.

65
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:24,233
It's the only world I live in

66
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,768
where there's no mistakes at all.

67
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,618
That's what makes it so wonderful.

68
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:32,912
Very little color.

69
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:34,108
Shoot, while I got that going,

70
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:35,600
let's just keep going.

71
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,539
Maybe we'll just

72
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,724
put a little bit of this blue all over.

73
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,549
We're gonna have a winter scene

74
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:44,343
and we're gonna need
some shadows in our snow,

75
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:46,796
so by applying a little blue down here,

76
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:48,139
we'll use that later on.

77
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,420
Automatically, this
will become our shadows.

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,537
And if worst comes to
worst, what the heck?

79
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:56,215
We'll turn it into a nice lake or pond or

80
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,557
whatever we want.

81
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:00,214
Doesn't matter.

82
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,646
That's what's so nice about this.

83
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:04,907
You can change your mind right mid-stream.

84
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,806
Okay, fun time.

85
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:08,897
Fun time.

86
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,114
Let's wash the brush.

87
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:10,990
As you know,

88
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,783
we wash our brush with
odorless paint thinner.

89
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:16,038
Shake it off.

90
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,585
And just beat the devil out of it.

91
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:20,859
Now, let's go back

92
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,331
with titanium white.

93
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,127
First of all, the prussian
blue is transparent.

94
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:26,618
It's very transparent.

95
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:28,883
Now, I'm gonna go into an opaque color.

96
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,568
The titanium white

97
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:32,544
and it is very opaque.

98
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:35,343
Very opaque.

99
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,072
Just a little color on here,

100
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,652
and let's go up in here

101
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,274
and let's just play a little bit.

102
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:42,597
Let's just pick out some areas

103
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,469
like this.

104
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:46,864
We want this painting, as I say, to be

105
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:49,019
very soft, very gentle

106
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,450
quiet little painting.

107
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:53,518
I don't want a strong,
distinct sky here that,

108
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,757
that,

109
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:55,832
will be distracting.

110
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:58,287
I want a very gentle,

111
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:00,542
quiet little sky.

112
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:04,001
And so that's what we shall have.

113
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,683
There.

114
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:09,656
In our world, we can create
any illusion that we want.

115
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,394
And today,

116
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:14,014
I want softness in our world.

117
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:16,043
Tranquility, quiet.

118
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:17,406
Peaceful.

119
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:20,605
Shoot, there's too much bad
stuff going on in our world.

120
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:24,314
We're gonna have a very peaceful place.

121
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:26,156
Everybody's happy,

122
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:28,129
even the little creatures.

123
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,876
There we are.

124
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,034
That's really, that's
really about all I want

125
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:34,501
for this sky.

126
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,013
I don't wanna do much more than that.

127
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,602
Something about like that.

128
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:41,969
And I get to wash the brush again.

129
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,411
All right.

130
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:46,112
I really, really just
wanted to wash the brush.

131
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:48,125
Shake it off.

132
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,975
(laughs)

133
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:53,422
You know they...

134
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:54,487
If you're gonna do this at home,

135
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:56,639
I suggest you get a little
thing called a brush meter rack.

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,652
It goes down in a garbage can,

137
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:00,587
'cause if you do this in your living room,

138
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:02,045
you're not gonna be very popular.

139
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,682
Guarantee.

140
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:05,182
Guarantee.

141
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:05,834
All right.

142
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,512
Let's go into a little black.

143
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:08,834
Very small amount of blue,

144
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,024
but there's very little paint.

145
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:13,096
Very little paint here,

146
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:15,069
and I just wanna

147
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:16,865
tap in some little indications,

148
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:19,055
barely touching the canvas.

149
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:21,384
Little indications far away,

150
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:22,745
far away,

151
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:24,795
almost the same color as the sky.

152
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:28,235
Very light, far away.

153
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:29,002
Remember that.

154
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,937
I keep saying it because it's important.

155
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:32,830
Now, you can take this...

156
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,891
I wanna blend the edges
out so it just disappears.

157
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:38,978
Just sort of disappears softly.

158
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,132
Softly.

159
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,029
I don't do a lot of soft
paintings on television

160
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:44,350
'cause they don't show up quite as well,

161
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,908
but I thought today,

162
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:48,134
we'll do one anyway.

163
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,936
There.

164
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:50,884
Softly.

165
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,388
Blending those edges out a little bit

166
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,104
so it just sort of disappears.

167
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,388
If you want to make this

168
00:05:56,387 --> 00:05:57,630
sort of look like it just,

169
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,901
I don't know, like it sort of flows,

170
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,675
almost like a watercolor,

171
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:03,985
leave a little more paint
thinner on your brush

172
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,905
because paint thinner and liquid clear,

173
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:09,175
they have a violent reaction

174
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,504
and it'll sort of just
grow and it's beautiful.

175
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:14,657
Looks like watercolor.

176
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:15,644
There.

177
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:17,786
Something about like that.

178
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,635
That's a little background

179
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:21,996
or something that's way back here.

180
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,593
We don't even care where it's at.

181
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:24,701
Far away.

182
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:26,732
Let's have one in the foreground,

183
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:28,567
a little closer to us.

184
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:29,651
We'll use the same color,

185
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,855
only a little more paint

186
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:32,257
and I'll add the least,

187
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:35,197
least little touch of
Van Dyke brown to it.

188
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:38,002
But there's still not a great
deal of paint on the brush.

189
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:40,077
Not a great deal. Let's go up in here.

190
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,794
Tell you what, let me show you something.

191
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,216
I'm gonna take

192
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:45,607
just the least little
touch of paint thinner.

193
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,756
Remember I told you that paint thinner

194
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,419
and liquid clear have a violent reaction.

195
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,336
Wipe off all the excess. Don't want much.

196
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,814
Then we just sort of tap
all these colors together

197
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:58,331
and

198
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,266
right here,

199
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,243
let's just begin tapping in
some basic little shapes.

200
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:06,719
Very, very basic.

201
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,812
There's paint thinner in here.

202
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,337
Not a lot.

203
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,487
I wiped all of it off, as you
saw, that I could get off,

204
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:14,849
but I didn't beat the brush.

205
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:17,298
So there's still some in here.

206
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:20,100
We're just putting indication
of all kinds of little things

207
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,025
that live up in here.

208
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,778
There.

209
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,153
All right.

210
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,002
What's the old saying?

211
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:31,843
You don't have to be crazy
to do this, but it helps.

212
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:34,408
Sometimes it does.

213
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:35,834
You really...

214
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,301
This is where you enjoy freedom on canvas.

215
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:41,754
Just let things happen. Let them happen.

216
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:43,911
There.

217
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,508
Now, this will continue

218
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,956
to dilute the paint thinner.

219
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:50,523
Will continue to dilute the liquid clear

220
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:52,277
and you'll get reactions
maybe for several hours.

221
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:54,212
It'll be very slight,

222
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,596
but it'll be a little bit different.

223
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,581
Let me show you. Watch here.

224
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,161
You can even take a little

225
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:04,095
paint thinner on the
fan brush and flick it.

226
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:06,883
Look at that! Look at that!

227
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:07,970
Isn't that gorgeous?

228
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,649
Look at those effects.

229
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,779
It makes one of the neatest
little nicest things

230
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:12,862
and all you gotta do...

231
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:14,653
See? Just flick it.

232
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:16,375
And you can use the knife to flick it

233
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,407
or I'm just using the side
of the palette, whatever.

234
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:19,908
Doesn't matter.

235
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,802
But that'll continue to work.

236
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:22,572
It looks...

237
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:25,192
Once again, it looks like a watercolor.

238
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,478
All right.

239
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,353
Let's put another little
bush. Same colors.

240
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,158
Just tapping.

241
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:33,652
Each layer gets a little bit darker

242
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:35,505
as it gets closer to us.

243
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,286
And maybe in our world,

244
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,137
there's one more little tree

245
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:42,844
lives right here.

246
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:43,581
We don't know.

247
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,062
Don't know that we even care
at this point in our life.

248
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,035
There. Just make all
kinds of little things.

249
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,494
Okay.

250
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:53,354
Yep, there's another one there.

251
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:54,634
Here's one here.

252
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,396
Sometimes you can just
take and push sidewards,

253
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:59,553
create all kind of little illusions here.

254
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:01,627
Is that another one?

255
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,639
Then I'll take it and pull it.

256
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,961
Lift it.

257
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,653
See there?

258
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,111
Pull those little things out.

259
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,670
That paint thinner

260
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:11,843
and clear will continue to
work for a while once again.

261
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,283
I like these kind of little paintings.

262
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:16,781
They're so soft.

263
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,550
So nice.

264
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,993
They're very moody little paintings.

265
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,800
Yeah, there we are.

266
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,077
Okay.

267
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:29,538
And that gives us a fairly
good little background.

268
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,552
You can enhance that a little,

269
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:33,346
taking a little paint thinner,

270
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:35,341
a little pit of white paint.

271
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,126
Put a little blue in it too
just to dull it a little.

272
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,511
And maybe, in our world,

273
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:40,772
maybe they're some little tree trunks

274
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:43,225
that live up through here.

275
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:45,421
Just a few.

276
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:46,532
There we are.

277
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:47,234
See?

278
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:48,536
You can pull it down, you can lift it up.

279
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:50,641
Whatever works well for you.

280
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:52,954
Few little things in here.

281
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:55,064
You can actually just
take plain paint thinner

282
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,646
and do this.

283
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:59,235
It'll lift the paint off the canvas,

284
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,715
and you can get basically the same effect

285
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:04,099
by just allowing the
canvas to show through.

286
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:06,809
There.

287
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,625
All kinds of little doers happening.

288
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:12,127
Now, we decided early

289
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,389
that this was gonna be winter.

290
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,192
Let's get the bravery test out here.

291
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:19,594
We'll go right into titanium white.

292
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,977
Titanium white. Let's go up in here.

293
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:25,434
Where is the snow?

294
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,932
The easiest way there ever was

295
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:30,038
to make snow.

296
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,348
There.

297
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,177
Just like it.

298
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,125
And it goes (makes painting
noise) right on across.

299
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,811
I don't know.

300
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:40,242
Now see, intentionally,

301
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:41,394
I went around this tree.

302
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:43,034
Now it looks like this tree is forward.

303
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:44,144
Does that make any sense?

304
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,762
I hope I'm saying that
right so you understand.

305
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,113
Sometimes I get so excited, I,

306
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:50,912
I don't say things right.

307
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:55,011
But that's just a neat effect, ain't it?

308
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,714
Look at that.

309
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:57,715
It's setting down in the snow.

310
00:10:57,715 --> 00:10:59,187
Right out there.

311
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:00,552
Let's see.

312
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,579
We decided we was gonna have
some buildings out here.

313
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,583
Maybe one of the easiest ways

314
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,844
that I've found to make a building

315
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,423
is take the knife,

316
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:09,235
and just firmly

317
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,081
scrape out a basic shape.

318
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:13,689
It does two things.

319
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:15,968
Most important, it removes excess paint.

320
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:19,344
Secondly, it allows you

321
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:20,688
to lay out your buildings.

322
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,503
Let's put a shed on
this one. What the heck?

323
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,762
Maybe that's an old
barn with a shed on it.

324
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:26,462
Like it.

325
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,522
But you can lay out a
whole series of buildings.

326
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:32,378
Maybe there're more than one.

327
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:33,874
Right there.

328
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:35,613
We don't care.

329
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,558
Without being committed, anyway,

330
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,458
that's what I'm trying to say.

331
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,840
You're not committed at this point.

332
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,663
There.

333
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,562
Let's take a little Van
Dyke, little dark cyan,

334
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:48,860
and mix it together.

335
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,532
Van Dyke and dark cyan.

336
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,345
I'm just gonna use them together.

337
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,684
And now, we can figure out here

338
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,100
where the dark part is.

339
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,234
And in my world, I think it's right here.

340
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,646
You don't have to stay in the
lines that you scraped out.

341
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:06,290
You can go anywhere you want with this.

342
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,542
There are no rules here other than

343
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,274
it should make you happy,

344
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:12,922
and whatever works, is good.

345
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,184
Whatever works.

346
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:18,665
Painting is such an individual thing.

347
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,908
Every person who's ever painted

348
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,041
has a different opinion of why it works

349
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,302
and how it should work,

350
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:27,071
but I believe

351
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:29,546
that it's an individual thing,

352
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:31,999
and if you're happy with your painting,

353
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,149
then the world's happy with it.

354
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:36,033
What's the old saying about

355
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,502
if you smile, the world
smiles with you and all that?

356
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,399
Same thing here.

357
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,677
We were gonna have a shed here. Forgot.

358
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:43,980
There.

359
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,029
Now, we can come back.

360
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,684
Still using a knife,

361
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,381
take a little bit of paint,

362
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:50,215
and maybe,

363
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,096
maybe this building here is straight on.

364
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:54,951
Let me get a little more paint there.

365
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:56,884
Straight on toward us.

366
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,749
And sort of allow that to break sometimes.

367
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:02,730
Makes it looks like the
snow sorta sliding down.

368
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,422
(makes sliding sounds)

369
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,084
Straight down.

370
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,616
Woops, got a little
doer hanging off there.

371
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,305
There.

372
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:14,379
All right.

373
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,471
A little bit more here

374
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:18,025
for the little shed.

375
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:20,875
There he is.

376
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,004
Looks like icicles right there already.

377
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:26,680
There.

378
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,065
Something about like it.

379
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:30,670
And that's quick enough

380
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,251
to give us an idea of a little building.

381
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,504
And we take a little
brown and a little white,

382
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:36,707
mix them together.

383
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:39,033
Little brown, little white.

384
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,332
Ooh, that's nice.

385
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:41,868
Don't overmix.

386
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:43,021
Touch.

387
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,098
Just pull gently down.

388
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:47,729
In my mind, I think this little shed

389
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:49,030
is not gonna get as much light,

390
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,416
so it's gonna be a
little darker back here.

391
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,634
So I'll make it a little darker

392
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:53,823
so he's pushed back a little more.

393
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,052
I think in my mind this side of the house

394
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,971
will be a little lighter than the front

395
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,400
or the barn, whatever this is.

396
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,492
I don't know what it is.

397
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,834
Whatever you want it to be.

398
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,271
A little more brown in there.

399
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:10,549
This side over here now is
very dark in comparison.

400
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:14,625
It's sorta, this is sorta
like a three-quarter view.

401
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:16,932
All right.

402
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:18,938
Clean off the knife.

403
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,132
Choose a little edge

404
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,344
and maybe there's a few
little windows in here.

405
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,070
Just doop, doop,

406
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,170
three...

407
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:26,609
There.

408
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,103
See? Whole line of little windows.

409
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:30,790
Maybe the cows live in here
and need a place to look out.

410
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,586
They wanna see what's
happening out here too.

411
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,264
There.

412
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,345
We'll put a couple
little windows in there.

413
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,412
It's your world.

414
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,115
You decide what's in there and what's not.

415
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,470
As I've mentioned many times before,

416
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,261
I sort of make up little
stories in my mind.

417
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm just pulling a little
brown through there

418
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,272
to make it look like old
boards living in there.

419
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:57,185
But these little stories,
they really help me.

420
00:14:57,184 --> 00:14:58,444
I don't know if they'll help you,

421
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,853
but I believe they will.

422
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,513
Make up little stories about your world.

423
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:07,099
Boy, that's some rough looking snow there.

424
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,384
Old snow laying up there.

425
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:14,036
We need snow on this other building.

426
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:16,172
(makes swooping noises)

427
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:16,918
There we are.

428
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,420
Little bit there.

429
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:21,099
All right.

430
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,500
Now, sometimes when you
have the clear there

431
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,678
this doesn't want to stick too good.

432
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:26,725
If that's the case, add
a little liquid white

433
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,452
to make your paint a little thinner.

434
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,310
Then it'll stick.

435
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:32,353
It's all you have to do.

436
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:35,559
Over here on this side,

437
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,982
put a little snow out there.

438
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:42,721
Little touch of brown, for
the eve or the overhang.

439
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:44,634
Like it.

440
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:46,841
Shoot.

441
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:49,201
We're 'bout to have an old building there.

442
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:51,682
And I want these to look like they've,

443
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,259
they've had a rough life.

444
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:55,303
Real rough life.

445
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:57,746
We'll take our big brush.

446
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:01,111
Little bit of snow right there.

447
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:03,462
Make a little shadow in the snow.

448
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,086
All we have to do is put a
little blue in there for that.

449
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:08,762
Little darker blue.

450
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:10,922
All right.

451
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:13,630
Over here (makes swooping noise).

452
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,629
Cut that off like that.

453
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,089
The side like it.

454
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,463
Now we're in business.

455
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:25,956
So we have two little buildings out here.

456
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,610
Little bit more of the blue color.

457
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,088
I put some blue down here,

458
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:34,860
but it's not as dark as I want it to be.

459
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,288
I want it to be a little bit darker.

460
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,058
So I'll just add a little more,

461
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:41,594
because in our world, we can
add anything that we want.

462
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,223
There.

463
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:46,242
Over in here.

464
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:47,950
You know,

465
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,889
a couple of shows ago,

466
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,509
I've mentioned something about this easel.

467
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,794
We have a brand new easel in this series.

468
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:56,354
And we've been absolutely flooded

469
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:59,430
with requests wanting
to know more about it.

470
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,505
What can I tell you?

471
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:03,932
It's a very unique easel.

472
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:05,639
The greatest thing about it

473
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,558
is the top comes off and
makes a tabletop easel.

474
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:09,221
It has four legs.

475
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:11,678
Most tabletop easels have three.

476
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:13,212
When you use a brush this big, you hit it,

477
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:15,027
they fall over.

478
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:16,326
That's always been a problem,

479
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,990
so we designed an easel

480
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,422
that has four legs

481
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:22,365
for the tabletop.

482
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:25,202
Then the nice thing about
it, you can order it

483
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:26,395
with just the top.

484
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,401
You just want a tabletop.

485
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,662
Then maybe later on you decide

486
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,557
you wanna get serious about it.

487
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:33,651
You can go back and order the bottom

488
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,669
and they go right together.

489
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:37,637
There.

490
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:38,810
And it...

491
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,199
It's available

492
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,246
I think it most better art stores

493
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:44,523
across the country.

494
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:48,050
If you can't find one, drop me a line.

495
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,346
I'll find out where they
are and let you know.

496
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,551
Okay.

497
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,640
Take a little blue, little white,

498
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,024
mix them together.

499
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,869
Maybe in our world...

500
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:03,252
Let's put the indication of...

501
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:06,580
Starts out here at nothing.

502
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,720
We'll just let it come round through here.

503
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,192
Just, maybe there's

504
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:12,198
just an indication of

505
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:13,821
a little path or road.

506
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,799
Little road.

507
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,799
Goes right through like that.

508
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,259
Just a little dabble.

509
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:22,198
Like it.

510
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:24,584
Comes right off the
edge of the canvas here.

511
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:27,931
This is just blue and white.

512
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,309
There we are.

513
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:34,445
And we'll bring a little
snow right up to it.

514
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,691
Let it just disappear right off the edge.

515
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,894
And you don't have to
be careful or anything.

516
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:41,257
You can clean that up...

517
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:42,644
when you come back with the snow,

518
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:43,944
you can clean up the edges.

519
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,817
You don't have to worry about it.

520
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:48,458
Just enjoy.

521
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,384
Just enjoy.

522
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:52,387
There.

523
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:53,326
Because maybe,

524
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:54,756
maybe the wind's blowing the snow

525
00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:56,718
half way over this little road.

526
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,171
You just can't make out

527
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,336
that there's a road there.

528
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:03,044
The old cows in the barn.

529
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:05,617
You gotta get up there
and take him some hay.

530
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,057
All right.

531
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:09,314
Don't want the old cow left out.

532
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,425
A little touch of the

533
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:12,066
alizarin crimson into the...

534
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,961
Least little touch into the white.

535
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:16,844
And maybe

536
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:19,699
nice distinct something right there

537
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,576
just to break it up.

538
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:25,890
There we go.

539
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,746
Little touch more of that crimson.

540
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:30,472
That gives it a little warm effect.

541
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:36,578
There.

542
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,155
See, it creates a whole other plain there,

543
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:40,113
even in the snow.

544
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,161
You know, look at this.

545
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,267
I think this farm's deserted.

546
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,303
The more I look at it, the more I think

547
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:50,114
I think this old farm were
abandoned, this place.

548
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,278
Yeah, all right.

549
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,901
Let's take a little of that brown.

550
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:56,924
Little paint thinner.

551
00:19:56,924 --> 00:19:58,693
Liner brush.

552
00:19:58,693 --> 00:19:59,762
Very thin paint.

553
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:01,232
Lot of it on the bristles.

554
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,240
Liner brush holds a lot of paint.

555
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,772
Maybe in our world...

556
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:07,826
Yup, maybe there's an old fence left here.

557
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:09,744
We can just do this

558
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:11,642
with a little liner brush.

559
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,413
As they go away from you,

560
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,220
let them get smaller

561
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:19,377
and closer together.

562
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,150
Closer together.

563
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:25,526
There. See?

564
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:28,467
And that'll help create
that illusion of distance.

565
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,201
Now, maybe there's a little snow on there.

566
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:33,188
I'll just dip into a little
bit of the liquid white.

567
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,833
Just pure liquid white

568
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,516
and we'll put the
indication of a little snow

569
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:40,262
hanging up here on some of these.

570
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:41,779
There.

571
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,366
(makes dropping sounds)

572
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,349
There they are.

573
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,542
Gotta make those little noises though,

574
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,757
or it won't work.

575
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:50,211
Take just the knife

576
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:52,701
and I'll go through a little bit of brown.

577
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,948
Use just the heel of the knife.

578
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:57,425
(makes swooshing noise)

579
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,710
Go right down, we'll put a
little wire on that fence.

580
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,135
Just the heel.

581
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:06,101
So, let it get wider as it comes forward.

582
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,638
There. Two strands of wire.

583
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,493
That easy.

584
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:11,351
That easy.

585
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,995
Wish it was that easy to
put that wire on your house.

586
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:14,975
Maybe there's a...

587
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:16,128
There's another old post up here.

588
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,092
I don't know.

589
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:20,263
Some kind of big old
post that lives there.

590
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:22,543
Little liquid white.

591
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:24,274
Need a little something hanging on him.

592
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:25,617
Sometimes it's nice to add a little blue

593
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,365
to the liquid white.

594
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:29,705
It'll make your snow look colder.

595
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:31,182
Much, much colder.

596
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:33,191
Let's use a one-inch brush.

597
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,405
I'm gonna go into a little white,

598
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:38,307
a little bit of the blue.

599
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:40,134
Little white, little bit of blue.

600
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,851
I want this to be sort of a,

601
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:44,827
a medium blue.

602
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,903
In our world,

603
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:48,845
maybe there's a few little
bushes that live back here.

604
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:51,083
I'm just looking for a little dark color

605
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,984
to make some light show up.

606
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:54,895
Maybe there's a happy bush lives there.

607
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:57,348
Looks like a tree.

608
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:59,588
Maybe,

609
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:01,298
maybe there's another one right in here.

610
00:22:01,298 --> 00:22:02,506
I don't know.

611
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:06,576
Maybe this gentleman takes
care of his yard like I did

612
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,291
and the bushes and the
trees are growing up

613
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,000
and taking over his farm.

614
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,440
Now,

615
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:15,112
another white

616
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:17,523
or another one-inch brush

617
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:19,291
going to liquid white.

618
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,872
Now, most important how
you load this brush.

619
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,020
Come right down here and watch here.

620
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,513
Pull that brush in one direction.

621
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:27,515
Isn't that a great close up?

622
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,018
That is fantastic.

623
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:31,509
Pull that brush in one direction.

624
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:32,940
Load a lot of color in it.

625
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,684
Watch.

626
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:34,664
Now, I'm gonna turn it over.

627
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:36,095
See how that's rounded?

628
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:38,932
You want that rounded
corner to go to the top.

629
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:40,702
You can also see right there,

630
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:42,281
we just taped this furrows.

631
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:43,668
I had people write in and they say

632
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:45,717
how come your brush looks
different than mine?

633
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:48,759
We put a little tape on those furrows

634
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,514
just to keep them from shining on TV.

635
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,225
It's identical to your brush.

636
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:54,966
Guarantee.

637
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:57,677
Now, with that nice, white color,

638
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:01,693
all you gotta to is just go
up here and barely touch.

639
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:03,834
Just barely touch.

640
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:06,151
We'll put a few highlights on these

641
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,336
snow covered now.

642
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,943
There.

643
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:11,670
Over in here.

644
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,099
Just a few little things.

645
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:13,931
Don't want a lot.

646
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:15,423
Just a few.

647
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:17,529
Just a few.

648
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:19,648
Now, my brush has got white on.

649
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,505
It'll work just as well.

650
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:23,637
Come in here.

651
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,746
And with that, you can very gently

652
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:26,961
clean up the bottom.

653
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:31,298
Sort of begin to bring all this together.

654
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:33,873
Just using white paint.

655
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,097
There. Pull that out.

656
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:37,830
See there.

657
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,366
We didn't add a simple

658
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,177
and super little,

659
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:42,247
little way to do,

660
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:45,359
maybe like a little farm
scene in the winter.

661
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:47,108
Now, if you live some place

662
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:48,281
where there's a lot of farms,

663
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:49,262
you can look around

664
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,505
and see the type of farms
that are in your area

665
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:54,236
and paint them to match

666
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:56,689
what you're used to seeing.

667
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:58,117
It's up to you.

668
00:23:58,116 --> 00:23:59,730
It's really up to you.

669
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,361
I just wanna show you how to do this.

670
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,331
What you do

671
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,545
is very individual.

672
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,577
All right.

673
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,768
Something like so.

674
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:12,775
Okay.

675
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:16,153
Shoot, I think we about got it here.

676
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:17,498
You might take...

677
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,865
Let's say this guy didn't keep his

678
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:21,073
grass cut very good,

679
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:22,659
so maybe around here,

680
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:24,428
we can put a few little sticks and twigs

681
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:25,922
around some of these posts.

682
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,081
They usually grow there because
you can't cut close to them.

683
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:31,720
There.

684
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:33,392
Something like it.

685
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,483
Let's take a little red,

686
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:37,963
a little paint thinner,

687
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:40,970
thin it down 'til it's the consistency,

688
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,254
almost the consistency of ink

689
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:45,491
and let's sign this little rascal

690
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:47,009
right there.

691
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:50,516
Just like so.

692
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,420
If your paint's very thin,

693
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:54,596
it'll flow right over the
top of this thick paint.

694
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,171
That easy.

695
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,513
Hope you've enjoyed this one.

696
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,837
It's a very, very simple little painting.

697
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:01,695
If you've never painted before,

698
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:03,272
this one you can do.

699
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:04,445
From all of us there,

700
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:06,427
I'd like to wish you happy painting

701
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:08,922
and God bless, my friend.

702
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:13,743
(mellow music)
