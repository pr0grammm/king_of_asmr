1
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:04,208
(mellow music)

2
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:32,884
- Hello, I'm Bob Ross,
and for the next 13 weeks,

3
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:37,168
I'll be your host as we
experience the joy of painting.

4
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:39,317
This is a fantastic method of painting,

5
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:41,371
where we use the wet-on-wet technique.

6
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,389
And before I go far into the show,

7
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:46,929
I'd like to take a few
minutes, and make a dedication.

8
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,469
I would like to dedicate this
show to my beloved friend,

9
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:54,265
and teacher whom we've all
watched and loved for many years,

10
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:57,814
on public television, Bill Alexander.

11
00:00:57,814 --> 00:01:00,868
And years ago, Bill taught
me this fantastic technique,

12
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:04,557
and I feel as though he
gave me a precious gift,

13
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:07,545
and I'd like to share that gift with you.

14
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,253
So, before we start, let's talk a minute

15
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:11,685
about the equipment that
we'll be using here.

16
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,817
We're using a stretch canvas,
rather than a canvas board.

17
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:16,540
The canvas board will absorb your

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,206
under-paint very rapidly, and become dry.

19
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,968
You need a strong easel,

20
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:24,440
because we use a lot of pressure here.

21
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,733
And you need an easel that would

22
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:28,685
grip the canvas and hold it securely.

23
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:30,777
The palette that we use,

24
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:33,221
we use a large palette that has

25
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:35,293
a lot of working area in it.

26
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:36,391
And I'm going to go over

27
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,681
each of the colors that we use here.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,096
And they'll be flashed across the screen,

29
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:42,528
so if you need to write them down,

30
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:45,588
you can pick them up off the
screen as I talk about them.

31
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:47,569
So, here we go, let's start right up

32
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:49,652
here with titanium white.

33
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:52,412
Thalo green.

34
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,206
Thalo blue.

35
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:56,900
Prussian blue.

36
00:01:58,269 --> 00:01:59,269
Burnt umber.

37
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,007
Van Dyke brown.

38
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,486
Alizarin crimson.

39
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:06,182
Sap green.

40
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:09,759
Cad yellow.

41
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,075
Yellow ochre.

42
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,157
Indian yellow.

43
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:16,657
And permanent red.

44
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:20,354
Now, these 12 colors we'll use every week.

45
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:21,974
So, if you wanna have your palette ready,

46
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:23,637
these are the colors that we'll use.

47
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:26,234
Also, each week, we'll run
the colors across the screen,

48
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:29,054
so in case you didn't get all of these,

49
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:31,093
you can pick them up the next time.

50
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,877
The brushes that we use.

51
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:34,545
These are natural bristle brushes.

52
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:37,733
I'm using a two and a half
inch and a one inch brush.

53
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:40,450
Also, we use an almighty palette knife.

54
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,577
A very big palette knife.

55
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:45,234
And this palette knife, unlike
traditional palette knives,

56
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:48,038
is very firm, it's very big.

57
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:51,262
So, we can do almighty
things very rapidly here.

58
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:53,250
So, let's do it.

59
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,562
Let's paint an almighty
picture right here.

60
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,962
I'm gonna start by dipping the brush into

61
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,613
a little bit of magic white.

62
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,806
Now, this makes the canvas wet,

63
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,466
it makes it slick, it allows
the paint to blend in here.

64
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:08,165
You actually blend the
painting on the canvas.

65
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:10,894
So, all we do here is
cover the entire canvas

66
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:12,774
with a thin layer of the magic white.

67
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:14,530
(bristling)

68
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,362
Alright.

69
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,521
Probably the biggest mistake
made when you first start,

70
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,745
is applying too much magic white.

71
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:23,194
All we want is just a
nice, thin, even coat.

72
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:24,841
(bristling)

73
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:25,914
And when you're using large brushes,

74
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:27,239
this only takes a couple minutes,

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,407
so no problem.

76
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:30,586
There we go.

77
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:35,719
Look it there, already
we're almost complete.

78
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:37,754
There.

79
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,658
Okay, I just work it back and forth,

80
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:44,824
and up and down to get a nice
even distribution of color.

81
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:48,425
Okay.

82
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,700
Just about got this canvas
covered with the magic white.

83
00:03:57,801 --> 00:04:00,021
Another big problem that
we run into continually,

84
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:01,938
is washing the brushes.

85
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,373
Now, I'm gonna wash the brush,

86
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,774
and we wash it with
odorless paint thinner.

87
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:10,066
And I strongly suggest
that you use odorless,

88
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:13,234
or you'll run everybody in
the house out in the yard.

89
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,810
You'll be there by yourself.

90
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,089
Now, you shake the brush into a box,

91
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,217
and then beat the bristles dry.

92
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,274
Now, if you do this at home,

93
00:04:22,274 --> 00:04:23,817
this is a quick way to redecorate your

94
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:26,029
living room in a second, so be careful.

95
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:27,993
Learn how to contain this.

96
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:30,426
Alrighty, let's do a simple
little picture today,

97
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:31,750
that'll just give you an idea of how this

98
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,733
fantastic technique works.

99
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:37,005
So, I'm gonna start here with
a little bit of Prussian blue.

100
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:39,253
And we pull a small amount of paint out,

101
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:41,218
and beat it into the bristles.

102
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:43,414
Really work this paint into the bristles.

103
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:44,765
You're looking for a nice even

104
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:47,470
distribution of color
throughout the bristles.

105
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,302
And we'll start right up here at the top,

106
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:50,665
and we just make little "X's",

107
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,850
little crisscross pattern.

108
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,194
Come all the way across the top.

109
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:58,021
There we go.

110
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:59,870
Now, your brush is picking
up the magic white,

111
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,780
and automatically the
sky is gonna get lighter

112
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,112
in value as it works toward the horizon.

113
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:07,087
There.

114
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,336
Okay, now see how easy that was.

115
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:13,786
Okay.

116
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:15,286
And very gently, we'll
just blend this out.

117
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:17,446
(bristling)

118
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:19,574
Now, it's very easy to make a sky darker,

119
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:21,614
but it's a son of a
gun to make it lighter.

120
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,025
If you wanted to make it a little darker,

121
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:25,194
all you do is add a little more blue.

122
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:26,646
A little more blue.

123
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:28,746
This stuff is really strong.

124
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,041
And go right back through
the same procedure.

125
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,958
You can darken the sky very easily.

126
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:35,866
Alright.

127
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:39,288
Another thing that seems to give

128
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:43,033
us a lot of problems, is almighty clouds.

129
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,317
So, let's spend a second
here and make us a cloud.

130
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:48,133
And, here we'll use the fan brush.

131
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:49,949
And, I'm gonna take the fan brush,

132
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,089
and load it full of titanium white paint.

133
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:54,965
Load it full.

134
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,382
Lot of paint in the bristles.

135
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:00,425
Okay, now,

136
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:01,545
we'll go up here and decide where

137
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,933
we want a happy little
cloud to float around.

138
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:05,362
And you touch the canvas,

139
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:08,331
and just make little tiny circles.

140
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:11,170
Just work it, work it, work it.

141
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,069
Do it rapidly.

142
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,781
Push hard and get away from it.

143
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:15,189
Don't keep working the same area,

144
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:19,002
all you'll have is a big
cotton ball up in the sky.

145
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:23,168
Okay, maybe we'll put another
little cloud right over here.

146
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:28,201
Just to show you how to
make these little clouds.

147
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,574
Okay, now,

148
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:30,985
with a large brush,

149
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:32,289
we wanna very gently,

150
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,290
blend this out on the bottom down here.

151
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,378
But, without touching the top at all.

152
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:39,127
So, very gently, just the bottom.

153
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:42,526
Just blend it a little bit.

154
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,276
Little, tiny circles.

155
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,159
There we go.

156
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:51,389
Now over here, we'll
blend this one a little.

157
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,081
Now, we'll fluff it.

158
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:56,262
And, we're just gonna gently lift upward.

159
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:57,095
And don't worry if you get some of these

160
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,428
little things up in the sky.

161
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:02,685
Okay.

162
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:06,721
Now, very gently, we'll hypnotize that.

163
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:07,721
There we go.

164
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:10,806
These are very simple,
very basic little clouds.

165
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,472
And very easy to do.

166
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:15,518
Now, if your brush sheds,
like it just did here,

167
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,213
and you get a hair on here,

168
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:19,230
just take a corner of
your bush and lift it off.

169
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,762
Don't spend all day trying to pick it off,

170
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,341
you'll have fingerprints
all over your painting.

171
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,093
Just use a corner of your brush.

172
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:26,927
Alright.

173
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:29,994
(water gurgling)

174
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:32,214
Let's now make an almighty mountain.

175
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:33,473
Everybody likes mountains.

176
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:35,229
No matter if you live
in Florida or Alaska,

177
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,970
mountains are still pretty.

178
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,850
I'ma take a little bit
of the Prussian blue,

179
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,858
some van dyke brown,

180
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:44,602
and a little touch of crimson,

181
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:45,762
very little crimson.

182
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:48,218
(scraping)

183
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,054
And, we'll mix that up real good.

184
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,537
Now,

185
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,250
all you need to do here is,

186
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,473
push this almighty knife
right into the canvas.

187
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,002
Just push.

188
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:00,822
(scraping)

189
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:04,988
You're really pushing the
paint right into the fabric.

190
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:07,199
There.

191
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:09,134
And all were looking for is just

192
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:11,968
a basic outline for this mountain.

193
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:16,442
And you may have noticed by now,

194
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,662
we use no patterns, we do no sketching.

195
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:22,725
We let this flow right our
of our heart onto the canvas.

196
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:23,559
There.

197
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:27,158
Now, with the larger brush,
I'm just gonna pull this down.

198
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,318
One thing about mountains
when you're painting them,

199
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:30,533
they should always be more distinct

200
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,498
at the top than they are at the bottom.

201
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:35,522
'Cause at the bottom of
the mountain we have mist,

202
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:37,410
and now we have pollution.

203
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,141
All of these things
diffuse and break up light,

204
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:43,063
and create the mist at the
bottom of the mountain.

205
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,843
So, once again we allow the magic white

206
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:47,225
to mix with the paint, and
this happens automatically.

207
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:48,590
We don't have to worry about it,

208
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,269
or think about it.

209
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,436
Let it happen.

210
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:53,862
Alright.

211
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,485
Let's put some snow on
this almighty mountain.

212
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:00,138
We'll use a little of the titanium white.

213
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,290
And we're gonna start
right up here on this peak,

214
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:06,169
and just let this paint flow
right down the mountain.

215
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,829
And you want the paint to break like this.

216
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,470
So it creates all the
little rocks and stone,

217
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,310
and highlights and
shadows in your mountain.

218
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:16,709
There.

219
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,485
(scraping)

220
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,615
Now,

221
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:24,615
light's gonna strike right
along this peak also.

222
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,254
And maybe,

223
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:31,004
just a little touch back in here.

224
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:33,937
Now, let's build some shadows.

225
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:34,830
And we'll just use a little bit

226
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,497
of the Prussian blue, and white.

227
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,045
Maybe a touch more.

228
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,078
There we go.

229
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:45,737
(scraping)

230
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:48,142
Now the shadows will run
in the opposite direction.

231
00:09:48,142 --> 00:09:49,806
We'll start here,

232
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:54,186
and just let the shadows
run right across like this.

233
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,936
There comes a shadow.

234
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:01,594
Okay, and we'll put one back here.

235
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:03,318
And, we've decided this peak,

236
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:05,193
is behind the mountain.

237
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:07,233
So, all we do is take this shadow,

238
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:08,913
and bring it right through.

239
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:11,860
And automatically, you've
just pushed a mountain around.

240
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,269
On this canvas, you're the creator,

241
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,761
anything that you want,
you can build here.

242
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:17,961
This is your world.

243
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:20,379
You're dreams come real here.

244
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,360
Alright.

245
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,192
There.

246
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,129
Now, maybe we'll add just a couple

247
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,129
more little peaks in here.

248
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,879
Maybe there's a happy
little peak right here.

249
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:40,446
We put the highlight in first.

250
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,598
And then we give him his own

251
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:47,109
private little shadow right there.

252
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,322
Now, this is a very basic,
simple little mountain.

253
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:51,625
And as the series progresses,

254
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,442
we'll do some that are a
little more complicated,

255
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,774
if this is too easy for you.

256
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:57,855
There we go.

257
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:01,102
Okay.

258
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:03,878
Now, as we had talked about earlier,

259
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:05,182
we always want it to be more distinct on

260
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:07,125
the top than it is on the bottom.

261
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,237
So, using the large brush here,

262
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:12,526
I'm gonna very gently tap
the bottom of the mountain.

263
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,689
I'm tapping, all I wanna do is diffuse.

264
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,773
I don't wanna destroy it.

265
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,370
There we go.

266
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:25,019
Always following the angles.

267
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:30,233
Now, very gently, lift
upward using the brush flat.

268
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,274
Look at that.

269
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,774
Look at that mist.

270
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,906
See, I knew you could do it.

271
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:42,322
Alright.

272
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:43,898
I think it's time we had some fun now.

273
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:45,423
Let's get over here into the sap green,

274
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:47,744
and just load this brush full of paint.

275
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:51,072
Just put a lot of paint into the brush.

276
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:53,935
Just really work it into the bristles.

277
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,278
And,

278
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:57,053
we're gonna go right along here,

279
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:58,670
and touch and push.

280
00:11:58,671 --> 00:11:59,504
Just push.

281
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,543
Just like so.

282
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,896
This is where you need the almighty easel,

283
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:07,655
because you're really pushing hard here.

284
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:11,366
You're pushing the paint
right into the fabric.

285
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,471
Okay.

286
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:13,471
There we go.

287
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,351
Just push it in.

288
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:21,720
This is just straight sap green,

289
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,134
and you're bending the bristles.

290
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:25,279
Most important that you bend the bristles.

291
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,980
(bristling)

292
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,812
There.

293
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:32,371
Okay.

294
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:38,632
Now, I'm gonna go into just
a tiny bit of Prussian blue.

295
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:41,276
And we'll darken the front here.

296
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,278
As things get closer
to you in a landscape,

297
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,945
they should get darker in value.

298
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:48,110
Alright.

299
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:50,408
You know while I'm doin' that,

300
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:53,126
one of the most interesting
things that we see,

301
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:56,250
as we run across the country
teaching this fantastic method,

302
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,639
is people continually say, "I
can't draw a straight line."

303
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,801
"I don't have the talent,
Bob, to do what you're doing."

304
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,223
That's bologna.

305
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:06,415
Talent is a pursued interest.

306
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,151
In other words, anything that
you're willing to practice,

307
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,895
you can do.

308
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,149
And this is no exception.

309
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:14,894
But it's like driving the car.

310
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,205
At first, it's a little difficult.

311
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,338
You have to learn how to make your hands

312
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:20,067
and your foots work together.

313
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,076
Same thing, and that's what
we're trying to teach you here,

314
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,494
is the technique.

315
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:27,406
Once you have the technique down,

316
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:28,750
all you need's a dream in your heart

317
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,437
and the desire to put it on canvas.

318
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:32,747
Okay.

319
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:33,581
Now,

320
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:39,187
let's go back here in the
background a little bit.

321
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:41,828
And, we'll mix up some blue,

322
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:44,358
this is Prussian blue.

323
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:48,168
Brown, Van Dyke brown,
in about equal parts.

324
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:49,053
And sap green.

325
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:52,097
All three of these are
in about equal parts.

326
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,266
And it should look very dark,

327
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,386
it should look black on your palette.

328
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:57,218
Okay.

329
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:01,139
Now, with the fan brush here.

330
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,937
We'll make some, let's
make some little evergreens

331
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:05,914
back here in front of
this almighty mountain.

332
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,403
And there's many, many ways to make them,

333
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:08,244
and we'll try to show you a bunch

334
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:11,115
of ways during this series.

335
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:13,530
Okay, we load the fan brush full of paint,

336
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,932
and decide where you want your tree to be.

337
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,754
You touch the canvas,

338
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:19,721
turn the brush sideways,

339
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:21,670
and just begin building a tree.

340
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:23,682
Back and forth.

341
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:25,014
Isn't that easy?

342
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:27,447
Looka there.

343
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:30,118
And, trees get lonely too,

344
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,129
they need a little friend,

345
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:34,296
so we'll give him a friend right here.

346
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:36,616
There.

347
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,283
And you know, sometimes,

348
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:40,977
you don't wanna a bunch of distinct trees,

349
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:43,011
you just want indications of trees,

350
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:44,547
so watch right here.

351
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,037
This is the way to make indications.

352
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:48,370
All we're doing is touching,

353
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:50,401
just touching.

354
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,579
And this looks like little trees,

355
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:55,125
when the painting's
finished it is way, way,

356
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,042
they're way back in the background.

357
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:00,730
And maybe over here.

358
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,407
Just drop these in.

359
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:07,841
This is, this is such a
free style of painting.

360
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,673
There.

361
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:13,525
And maybe there's some here
that are a little closer.

362
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:14,788
There, we'll just drop them in,

363
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,587
let them, let them just fall
right off your fan brush.

364
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:19,587
There we go.

365
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:23,573
There we go.

366
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,906
(bristling)

367
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:28,808
Okay, we'll put a little
more dark in here.

368
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,344
You need dark in order to show light,

369
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:34,066
so here I'm just applying
a little dark color.

370
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:34,899
Now,

371
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:38,144
another golden rule that
you need to remember here.

372
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:40,734
A thin paint will stick to thick paint.

373
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,958
So, I'm adding just a touch of magic white

374
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:45,817
on my brush here to go
through this thicker paint.

375
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:47,048
And this will make it a little bit thinner

376
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:48,985
so it'll stick on top of the thick paint.

377
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:50,149
This is why we're,

378
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,946
we're able to paint wet-on-wet.

379
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,596
Okay, now, let's put
some happy little things

380
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:57,092
happening back in here.

381
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:59,716
Just some little bushes and stuff,

382
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:01,812
here they come, down the hill.

383
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,729
Just let them progress.

384
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,135
There we go.

385
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:14,903
There.

386
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:17,570
Look at all them little rascals.

387
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:21,346
Okay.

388
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,894
With a knife here, I'm
just using the point,

389
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:25,976
and I'll scratch a few
little trunks here and there.

390
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:28,169
(scratching)

391
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:29,351
See, already it looks like we have a

392
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:32,231
multitude of trees and stuff back here.

393
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:33,865
Okay.

394
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:37,053
Now, let's move a little
forward in the painting.

395
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:39,995
And, I'm gonna come right about here.

396
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:41,525
There we go.

397
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:44,815
And we'll drop a bigger tree in here.

398
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,699
There he goes.

399
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:47,698
There he is.

400
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:51,818
There.

401
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:53,091
These little trees live in your fan brush,

402
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:56,423
and you have to scare them out sometime.

403
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,400
There.

404
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:02,557
See, I knew you could do it.

405
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:05,339
(bristling)

406
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,091
Just let that come right on down.

407
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:09,884
Maybe there's some trees on
the other side over here too.

408
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:13,037
Let's, let's put an
almighty tree right here.

409
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:15,422
We're having such a lot
of fun doing these trees,

410
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:17,243
we might as well just
keep going with them.

411
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,576
(bristling)

412
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:27,788
Okay.

413
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:28,621
And by now, you're probably saying,

414
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,456
"Hey, can he do anything but evergreens?"

415
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:33,902
Alright, let's do some
different types of trees.

416
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:35,923
And, we'll take a one inch brush

417
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:38,674
and load some of the
same color on it here.

418
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,629
And let's put in,

419
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,047
some leafy trees.

420
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:45,307
There we go.

421
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:47,155
Just push them right off your brush.

422
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:48,068
Bend the bristles.

423
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,837
Most, most important that
you bend the bristles.

424
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:54,671
See you get all the
actions that happen there.

425
00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:59,560
Okay, and maybe over
here a nice little tree.

426
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,394
There.

427
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:07,566
There we go.

428
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:10,262
Now, let's put a little trunk in here.

429
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:12,878
I'll use a little bit of burnt umber,

430
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:15,647
(scraping)

431
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:19,314
and let's just lay some
happy little trunks.

432
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:23,439
Okay, in the little evergreen trees.

433
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,777
Just here and there.

434
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:26,777
There we go.

435
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:33,690
And maybe a trunk in this
big ol' tree over here.

436
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:35,623
Like so.

437
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:36,456
One in there.

438
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:37,707
You can also take just
the point of your knife,

439
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,114
and scratch right through the paint,

440
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:41,431
and put all kinds of
little indications in here.

441
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,847
(scratching)

442
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:46,716
Alright.

443
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:50,469
A little more of the thin paint,

444
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:51,969
to thin this down.

445
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,759
And we'll put some happy
little highlights on there.

446
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,518
Maybe we'll say this is,

447
00:18:57,518 --> 00:19:00,450
this looks like fall, so let's
use some bright colors here.

448
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,950
And they show up good on your set at home.

449
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,637
Look at that son of a gun.

450
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,051
Okay, now,

451
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:16,551
there we go.

452
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:19,835
Alright, now,

453
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,622
down at the bottom, down here,

454
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:25,199
we need some nice little
bushes that are happening.

455
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,422
One thing to be very careful of,

456
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:27,846
don't kill all your dark areas.

457
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:28,981
If you kill them,

458
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,648
your painting becomes very flat.

459
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,373
There we go.

460
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:43,689
And, maybe there's a happy
little bush right here.

461
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,428
And a big ol' one here.

462
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:48,596
Big tree here.

463
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:54,792
Alright.

464
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,820
Maybe a little something underneath here,

465
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,178
just to give it a little more depth.

466
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,179
There we go.

467
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:06,905
Now, we'll cut a few more

468
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,019
little sticks and twigs here and there.

469
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:09,852
(scratching)

470
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:12,165
And this helps create
depth in the painting.

471
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:14,211
It shows different planes.

472
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:15,512
The more planes you can show,

473
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:17,995
the deeper the painting will be.

474
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:22,221
So, we'll just cut a few of them in here.

475
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,829
You know, it's interesting,

476
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:26,261
I was doing this painting
one time at a mall,

477
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:27,854
and I had a man come along, and he says,

478
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:29,944
"You know I've been to that location."

479
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:32,406
He says, "Except it had
a little pond right here,

480
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:33,754
"if it had a little pond there,

481
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:35,570
"I'd buy that painting from you."

482
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,096
So I told him, I said, "You
start writing the check,

483
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:39,375
"and by the time the check's done,

484
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,783
"you'll have a little pond."

485
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:43,071
So, watch right here,
let's see what happens.

486
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,007
All you do is take this almighty brush,

487
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:46,174
and pull down.

488
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:52,296
And we'll create a
little pond right there.

489
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:53,546
It's that easy.

490
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:56,998
There we go.

491
00:20:56,998 --> 00:21:00,074
(bristling)

492
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:02,950
And I'm gonna take a little
bit of Prussian blue,

493
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,317
just to make this pond
a little bit deeper.

494
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:08,244
I wanna have enough room for
the trout to live in here.

495
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:10,327
Just a little bit deeper.

496
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:13,061
This is one thing that's

497
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:15,137
so fantastic about this style of painting.

498
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:17,534
Right, right in mid-stream,
you can change your mind,

499
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:20,287
you can, you can, completely,

500
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:23,283
completely change a
painting in just a second.

501
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,510
And here, I'm just pulling across

502
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,760
to make it look like water.

503
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,587
Isn't that something?

504
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:31,955
Now, we'll take just a tiny
bit of the magic white,

505
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:34,387
(scraping)

506
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:36,098
and we'll put a little waterline in here.

507
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,515
(scratching)

508
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:41,802
There.

509
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,184
Just act like you're trying to cut a hole,

510
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:45,894
right through the canvas.

511
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:47,228
And, let's take,

512
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:50,342
and,

513
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,267
I sort of wiped out a couple
of these little bushes here.

514
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:56,114
So, let's just put them back in.

515
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,475
And maybe on each side there,

516
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:00,141
we have some nice little bushes.

517
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:01,937
Okay.

518
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:04,769
Now, I'm gonna add just a tiny bit,

519
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:06,904
of the Van Dyke brown,

520
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:09,785
and the burnt umber to this
magic white to make it,

521
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:12,426
it's a very, very thin paint.

522
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:14,826
And with that, we'll just take and

523
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:17,084
pull down here a little bit.

524
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:19,870
And make us a nice little bank here.

525
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:22,296
Just some, just some ground for the,

526
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:24,683
bushes and trees here to set on.

527
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:25,864
Don't want them to fall off in the water,

528
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:27,364
make a big splash.

529
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:32,047
That'd disturb that old
trout that lives in there.

530
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:32,880
There.

531
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,124
Now, maybe highlight it with
just a tiny bit of white.

532
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,201
And, this is a very, very gentle touch.

533
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:43,884
Just enough to get the
paint to come off the knife.

534
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:44,884
There we go.

535
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:49,717
Isn't that something?

536
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,773
Now, with just a little
touch more of magic white,

537
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,628
we'll put a little
waterline right under here.

538
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:57,444
(scratching)

539
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:58,444
There it is.

540
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:02,319
Just enough to separate this.

541
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:06,516
There.

542
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:11,737
A few more little sticks here and there,

543
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,403
just to break it up.

544
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,426
Maybe there's some little
grassy things that's sort of

545
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:20,115
worked down onto the bank here.

546
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:20,948
Just here and there.

547
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:23,143
Over here ought to be some.

548
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:25,341
What happens if you change you mind again?

549
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,673
Son of a gun.

550
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,931
Let's change it again.

551
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:29,764
I'ma take the big brush and

552
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:33,930
go right back into this dark
color and begin pushing,

553
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:36,767
like so.

554
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:39,638
And we'll just add another
plane to the painting,

555
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:41,926
and make it even deeper.

556
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:43,310
Just push this dark in there.

557
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:47,912
Once again, we need the dark
in order to show the light.

558
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:51,222
Okay, now we got our dark in there.

559
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,857
Now, we can highlight it.

560
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:55,440
Little more of the thin white here,

561
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,381
so we can thin this down,
and it sticks nice and easy.

562
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:03,309
We use a little yellow ochre
mixed with a little cad yellow.

563
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,663
And mix it on your brush,

564
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:08,789
that way you get a multitude
of things that happen.

565
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:09,983
Maybe a little of the permanent red,

566
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:10,817
let's put...

567
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,650
Oh!

568
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,325
There's a little fireball.

569
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:15,825
That's a nice one.

570
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:20,215
And, right on down through like so.

571
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:24,956
And just let these flow
with the lay of the land.

572
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:26,028
And put all kind of little,

573
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:28,815
look at all those little grassy things.

574
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:29,981
There they go.

575
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:32,691
Just as easy.

576
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:37,485
Okay,

577
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:38,525
now,

578
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:42,012
we'll just cut a few little
sticks here and there.

579
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:43,095
There we are.

580
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,417
You know one of the hardest

581
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,459
things to do when you're painting,

582
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,670
is to know when in the world to stop.

583
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,668
It's just, it's such a
temptation to add one more stick,

584
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,290
or one more tree.

585
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,734
And there comes a time
when you have to stop,

586
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:58,425
or you piddle it to death.

587
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:00,042
So,

588
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,039
I think we're gonna stop on that one.

589
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,401
Show you how to sign a painting.

590
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,105
This is something that gives
people a lot of trouble.

591
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,691
And I'm gonna dip,

592
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:09,909
this is a number two script liner.

593
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,678
And I'm gonna dip it into
a little bit of thin oil.

594
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,587
And then, use the liner brush

595
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:18,381
and make the paint so it's like water.

596
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:19,596
Very, very thin.

597
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:21,358
Then it'll flow right on top of there.

598
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,726
And turn this brush, twist it.

599
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:28,047
That brings it to a
nice, firm, sharp point.

600
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:28,880
Okay.

601
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:31,484
Now,

602
00:25:31,484 --> 00:25:33,521
let's sign it right here.

603
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:35,521
And, all we do is touch,

604
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:38,817
and just let this paint flow,

605
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,884
right off this little liner brush.

606
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:42,884
There we go.

607
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,453
And, luckily, I have a very simple name.

608
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:47,955
It's easy to spell, and only takes a

609
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:50,122
second to sign a painting.

610
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,645
And next week,

611
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,528
I hope you have your canvas on your easel,

612
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:58,529
and you're all ready to go with us.

613
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:00,692
And, we'll be doing a
white canvas next week.

614
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,526
During the series,

615
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,269
we're gonna do numerous different things.

616
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,451
There will be several paintings

617
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:06,385
that we do on a black canvas.

618
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:08,607
Oh, there'll be some
that you won't believe,

619
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:11,778
but next week, have a white canvas ready.

620
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,583
You have the colors.

621
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:16,157
And we'll be looking for you here,

622
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:17,768
and until then,

623
00:26:17,768 --> 00:26:19,951
from all of us here.

624
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:21,934
We'd like to wish each
and every one of you,

625
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:25,030
happy painting and God bless.

626
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,614
(mellow music)
