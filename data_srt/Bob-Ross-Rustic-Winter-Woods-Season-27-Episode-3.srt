1
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:04,122
- Hi, I'm certainly glad to see you today,

2
00:00:04,123 --> 00:00:05,423
because I thought today we'd do a painting

3
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,923
that's just a lot of fun.

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,426
Let's start out and have
them run all the colors

5
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,060
across the screen that you need

6
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,829
to do this little painting with us.

7
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,331
And while they're doing
that, let me show you

8
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,932
this craziness I've got up here today.

9
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,704
Today, I took my standard
old pre-stretched

10
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:21,172
double-primed 18 by 24 inch canvas,

11
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:22,373
but once again, you can use any size

12
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:23,442
that's convenient for you.

13
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:24,609
I just like this size because it fits

14
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,945
a television screen good.

15
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:30,280
I took a paper towel and acrylic paint,

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,716
now we're using oils,
but I used acrylic paint

17
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:35,454
to put a dry undercoat on here.

18
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:37,256
Now, I just took a paper towel,

19
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:40,524
and a little bit of sienna and umber,

20
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:43,061
and just dabbed it, just everywhere.

21
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:45,562
Then here, I found an old
filbert brush and just

22
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:47,632
pulled a couple things through.

23
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,166
And I allowed all that to dry.

24
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,837
Now I've covered the entire
canvas with liquid clear.

25
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:53,703
The liquid clear just
makes it wet and slick.

26
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:55,873
That's really all it's there for.

27
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,208
The bottom of the
canvas, then I've covered

28
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:01,746
with a mixture of Sap
Green and Alizarin Crimson.

29
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,414
That makes a gorgeous brown color.

30
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:04,617
And I thought I'd wait until you got here

31
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:07,751
to do the top part so you can
see exactly how it's done.

32
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,487
Now sometimes when I'm
walking through the woods,

33
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:12,057
which I do frequently, sometimes the sun's

34
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:14,793
coming through the trees and
you see this beautiful glow

35
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:16,661
coming right through the trees.

36
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:19,464
And some of the trees that
are close to that glow,

37
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:21,298
they sort of just disappear into it.

38
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,936
And that's the effect I
was trying to achieve.

39
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:27,638
And I'm gonna show you a
very easy way to make that.

40
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:28,606
All right.

41
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:31,542
Let's go today, we use a two
inch brush to get started here.

42
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:32,344
I'm going to go right into

43
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,911
a little bit of the Indian Yellow.

44
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:37,181
I like Indian Yellow because
it's very transparent.

45
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,650
Very transparent, it's a gorgeous color.

46
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,350
Let's go right up in here.

47
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,489
Now with that, right over this acrylic,

48
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,391
with the liquid clear on it.

49
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:51,929
I'm just going to cover
the entire canvas here.

50
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,764
The entire top part of it.

51
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:57,334
The bottom is covered
with that brownish color.

52
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,685
There.

53
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,923
Just like so.

54
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,209
About like that.

55
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,579
It's really all we have to do right now.

56
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,546
But see how easy that goes on.

57
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,682
If you don't have the clear on there,

58
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:15,502
the liquid clear, this is
quite a job putting it on.

59
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,489
I've got now since we have the clear,

60
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,461
I use this any time that
I'm using a black canvas.

61
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:25,695
Or a canvas that has some
color or design on it.

62
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,298
It makes it so much easier.

63
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,935
I'll go right into, I made a
little of that brown color.

64
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:33,437
Once again, it's Alizarin
Crimson and Sap Green

65
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:34,973
in about equal parts.

66
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:36,639
I just went ahead and
mixed up a little pile here

67
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,807
because I'm going to
use a lot of it I think.

68
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:42,447
And right up here in the corner,
I'll add a little bit more.

69
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,549
I just want to darken this corner.

70
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,653
Make it look like a sun's
shining through here.

71
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:50,822
About like that, and
that's really all we need.

72
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:52,724
It's all we need.

73
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:53,292
There.

74
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:54,926
Okay, let me wash the brush.

75
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,227
If you've painted with us before,

76
00:02:56,227 --> 00:03:00,397
you know this is the most fun
part of this whole technique.

77
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,167
We wash it with odorless paint thinner,

78
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:05,235
shake it off.
(brush thuds)

79
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:08,739
(laughs) And just beat
the devil out of it.

80
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,076
Good way to take out all your
hostilities and frustrations.

81
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:16,128
I want to take a little
bit of the Cadmium Yellow

82
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:19,250
and put it right over here
with some Titanium White.

83
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,218
Don't need a lot of white.

84
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,822
Let's go up in here.

85
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:24,990
Now figure out where the
sun lives in your painting.

86
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,623
I think it's right there.

87
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:30,094
Take the corner of the
brush and we'll start there.

88
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:31,862
And we'll begin working outward.

89
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:34,399
I want this to be very bright.

90
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,733
It'd go right over these trees.

91
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,870
I want to just absolutely blend them out

92
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,872
where the light's going to
be zinging through there.

93
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:44,174
Just blend them out.

94
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:45,893
Little more of the white.

95
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:47,979
There.

96
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:48,646
Right in there.

97
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,714
Want that to be very bright.

98
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:52,549
If that's our hot spot.

99
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:55,219
That's the source of our
light in this painting.

100
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,055
And you can do this as
many times as you desire

101
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:01,527
to achieve a desired lightness.

102
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:02,860
But I suggest each time you do,

103
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,562
get a clean brush or clean your brush.

104
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:08,683
Just depending on how
many brushes you have.

105
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:09,868
There.

106
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,937
We'll just let this little
glow just work its way out.

107
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:15,506
Already you can see how those
trees are almost disappearing

108
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:19,177
in that strong direct sunlight.

109
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:23,248
And that's exactly the effect
that I was trying to achieve.

110
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,415
And this makes it so simple.

111
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,634
So simple.

112
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,887
There.

113
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,425
And then we'll just blend
the entire thing out.

114
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:34,960
Now already, that looks like a
sunlight coming through there

115
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,344
so strong it almost hurts your eyes.

116
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,097
Fantastic.

117
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:42,934
That easy.

118
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:44,502
All right.

119
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:45,906
I'll tell you what.

120
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:48,139
Let's use the old filbert brush today.

121
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,608
I like the filbert brush.

122
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:50,608
I'm just going to go into a little bit

123
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,742
of the Titanium White
with the filbert brush.

124
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:55,413
Just load both sides up.

125
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:57,247
Both sides up, something like so.

126
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,117
A lot of color.

127
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:01,018
Fully loaded on both sides.

128
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,520
Now maybe in our world back here,

129
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,655
let's make this a winter scene.

130
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:05,455
It can be winter or summer.

131
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,057
I think we'll do winter today.

132
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,560
Maybe back in here we
touch and there's just

133
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,030
a little indication of some
snow that lives back here.

134
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,364
Barely touch the canvas.

135
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:16,300
I want to just graze it.

136
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,967
Just graze it.

137
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:19,102
I want it just to begin picking up

138
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,572
some of that color we have underneath.

139
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,142
Just graze it though.

140
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:26,343
It has that brown underneath

141
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:29,747
so it's going to pick
up a little bit of that.

142
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,615
All we're doing is just grazing.

143
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,252
Sometimes you can put
a lot of paint on there

144
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,287
and just let it bounce along and break

145
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:39,757
and by break I mean it has all
these little holes in there.

146
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,158
Barely touching.

147
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:43,826
Just, let it just drag across the canvas.

148
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:45,295
Allow the canvas to do the work.

149
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:47,998
Let it pull off the paint that it wants.

150
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,768
Then what's left on the brush

151
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,584
you can just sort of scrub it in.

152
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:54,105
And work back and forth.

153
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:57,057
Where you want to highlight,
put it on very thick.

154
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,260
There.

155
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,944
About like that.

156
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,648
Now.

157
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:05,283
As I've mentioned earlier,
I've already mixed up

158
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,753
a large pile here of the
Alizarin Crimson and Sap Green

159
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,055
to make a beautiful brown color.

160
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:13,790
Now you can, you can take
that to the reddish side

161
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,558
by adding more crimson
or to the greenish side

162
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,362
depending on your mood.

163
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:19,028
I usually go a little
more to the reddish side.

164
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,298
I sort of like that.

165
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,334
A lot of color on the brush.

166
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:23,201
Shoot.

167
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:24,234
We might as well check you out

168
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,137
for bravery right off in this painting.

169
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,171
Maybe.

170
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:29,439
You ready?

171
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,973
Maybe (whistles) right there.

172
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:34,677
Just pull it down.

173
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:36,047
A lot of paint on the brush.

174
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:39,117
Very thick, very thick.

175
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:39,984
Let's have a,

176
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,086
let's have a whole grove of trees.

177
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:43,822
Maybe it's wintertime.

178
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:46,792
These trees have lost their leaves.

179
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,792
Lost their leaves.

180
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:52,079
The snow's just beginning
to collect on the ground.

181
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:55,467
All the little squirrels and stuff.

182
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:56,899
They're probably up here hibernating,

183
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,370
taking life easy for the winter.

184
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,020
There.

185
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,007
All right.

186
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,641
If you watch the show in the past,

187
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,875
you know I like little squirrels.

188
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,076
I have a bunch of squirrels.

189
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:10,747
I raise, well I usually raise anywhere

190
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,000
from two or three to
a half a dozen a year.

191
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:15,885
Turn them loose.

192
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:17,254
I have the good fortune of working with

193
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:20,359
a lot of the rehab people
around the country.

194
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,626
Here in Muncie there's a lovely lady

195
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:25,396
named Diana Schaffer that
takes care of animals

196
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:28,064
and she's taught me a tremendous amount

197
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,416
about all these little creatures.

198
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:33,336
And in Florida there's several

199
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:36,073
other people that I work with.

200
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:39,443
I like to work with
animals, and these people,

201
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:41,312
they work with injured
and orphaned animals

202
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:42,747
and devote their whole life to it

203
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:45,548
and I have a great respect for them.

204
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,282
There.

205
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,384
I want these trees instead of

206
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,750
the nice smooth ones we usually make.

207
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,658
Let's make some trees
today that have character.

208
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:54,824
These trees are not going to

209
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:57,060
end up as future telephone poles.

210
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,262
Guarantee you.

211
00:07:58,262 --> 00:07:59,730
I want them to be ragged.

212
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,584
(grunts) Rough, rough.

213
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,471
That's what my dog said when
he sat down on the sandpaper.

214
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,889
Rough.

215
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,709
Bad joke.

216
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,377
Now I'm pushing because I want

217
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:15,612
a lot of little things
to happen with the brush.

218
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:18,182
Normally you would pull so
you'd get a smoother line.

219
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:20,217
I want the roughness today.

220
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:23,721
I want these trees to look like,

221
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,657
oh, it's been a rough life out here.

222
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:27,625
See?

223
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,274
Pulling the edges out.

224
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,027
Really rough.

225
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:33,764
This is a place you wouldn't want to go

226
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,365
in the middle of a dark night.

227
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,750
It's one of them scary places.

228
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,701
There.

229
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:40,971
When I was young, there was some places

230
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,370
where I lived that,

231
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,807
they were just sort of scary.

232
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:46,177
You'd be out the evening
and it started getting dusk,

233
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,812
you could make out all kind of monsters

234
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,362
that lived in there.

235
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:51,883
There we are.

236
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:53,518
But we lived way out in the woods.

237
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,853
I grew up in Florida.

238
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,418
And we lived so far back in the woods

239
00:08:57,418 --> 00:09:00,223
they used to have to
pipe sunlight into us.

240
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:02,026
There.

241
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:02,693
All right.

242
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:03,626
See how all them all limbs.

243
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,195
We'll come back with a liner brush

244
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,931
and put in a few little ones.

245
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:10,317
But I really want these
old raggedy looking things.

246
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,769
Shoot, I like that.

247
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,138
I want a tree over here.

248
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:15,139
This is our world, so we can

249
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,755
put trees anywhere we want them.

250
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:21,044
Maybe it comes all the way down to there.

251
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,779
I don't know.

252
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,981
You make that decision.

253
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,653
And this painting's great if
you've never painted before.

254
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,022
This is an easy one.

255
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,390
You can do this one.

256
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:33,258
You can do this one.

257
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:35,893
We try to do some paintings in each series

258
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:38,846
that work so well those
who are just beginning

259
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,365
can have outstanding results with them.

260
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,100
Or people who've painted a little bit,

261
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,104
they can just have fun with them.

262
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:46,638
And we try to do some paintings

263
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:48,639
that have a little more challenge to them

264
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,841
for those that have painted for a while

265
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:52,510
and they need a little more challenge.

266
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,211
I'm just taking the brush
and rubbing it up and down.

267
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,413
I want to make the indication of some

268
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,815
little bushes that live way back here.

269
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:01,636
Gotta have a place for my
little friends to hide.

270
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,519
There.

271
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,423
Probably, a little racoon
lives right in there.

272
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,259
There we go.

273
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,496
I like little racoons when they're little.

274
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,865
They are the cutest little devils.

275
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,834
I got a letter from
somebody here a while back,

276
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:20,272
they weren't happy that I was condoning

277
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:22,573
keeping these animals as pets.

278
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:25,074
Let me emphasize, strongly.

279
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:28,145
I do not keep these animals as pets.

280
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:32,348
I only try to help the
rehab people raise them up,

281
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,051
and then they're turned
loose back to the wild,

282
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,121
because that's where God
intended for 'em to be.

283
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,922
I have all these little
squirrels in my backyard

284
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:40,990
that I've raised, and

285
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,793
it's funny, people come
to the house, (laughs)

286
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,063
and they're like little puppies.

287
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,130
I'm not exaggerating,

288
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,500
they literally, they come to my back door,

289
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,403
in fact, they've ate a hole
through my screen on the patio.

290
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,772
But they come through the screen,

291
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:57,041
and they come to the back door,

292
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,043
and they scratch on the door

293
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,844
like a little puppy,
wanting me to come out

294
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:02,280
and bring 'em some goodies.

295
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,015
They know I'm a soft touch.

296
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:06,418
(blows air)

297
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,852
I just decided I was talking so much,

298
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,770
I'm gonna put another tree in.

299
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,156
But isn't this an easy way

300
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:15,927
to make some gorgeous,
old rough looking trees?

301
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,594
Tough old trees.

302
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:20,131
There we go.

303
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,266
Just get a general idea of
where we want 'em to be.

304
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,835
I like that.

305
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,971
Now, I've got a couple
of filberts going here,

306
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:29,643
so I don't have to spend all
my time just cleaning them.

307
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:32,142
Maybe back in our world, here,

308
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,343
just make a decision.

309
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,911
(whistles)

310
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:38,081
Maybe there's some more
snow lives right in there.

311
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:40,350
I don't know.

312
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,654
You know, painting is
such an individual thing.

313
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:46,990
Don't just try to copy
somebody else's work.

314
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,826
Just do your own thing.

315
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:53,297
We each see nature through
totally different eyes,

316
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,432
and that's what you're to paint.

317
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:57,732
I say that over and over,
because I just don't,

318
00:11:57,732 --> 00:12:00,803
I don't want to teach people to copy.

319
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,039
Shoot, anybody can copy.

320
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,278
Creative freedom,
though, is where it's at.

321
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,382
That's really The Joy of Painting.

322
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:11,982
There.

323
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,550
We use no patterns, no sketches,

324
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,586
we let our imagination take us to worlds

325
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:19,057
that we can only imagine.

326
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,890
We can do that.

327
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,461
We can do that, we can do anything.

328
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,966
Anything, at least on this canvas we can.

329
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,033
Maybe there's another little
bush lives right here.

330
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,104
I've mentioned before, on this canvas,

331
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:35,506
I have absolute and total power.

332
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,074
I can do anything here my heart desires,

333
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,912
I can change the course of mighty rivers,

334
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:41,946
anything.

335
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:42,947
When I go home,

336
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:45,581
the only thing I have any
power over is the garbage.

337
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,351
It sits there and waits on me.

338
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,919
There we are,

339
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,188
but that's okay.

340
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,225
I can always escape to
this piece of canvas

341
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:58,862
and create any illusion that I want.

342
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,131
So can you.

343
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,798
Maybe there's a big old root on this tree,

344
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:05,703
it comes right out like that.

345
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,537
Like that.

346
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,207
Let's put some arms on
this old tree. (grunts)

347
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,376
Once again, I'm pushing
a lot with the brush,

348
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:16,079
just to make them all gnarly.

349
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,014
Is that a word?

350
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:21,786
My son Steve and I are both
bad about making up words.

351
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:22,952
I learnt that from him,

352
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:25,655
he didn't learn it from me, of course.

353
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:28,425
There we go.

354
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:31,061
Old Steve, if you've never had
a chance to watch him paint,

355
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:35,966
that son of a gun is one dynamite painter.

356
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:39,001
He's almost, what, 27 years old now.

357
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,536
Hey, and this is the 27th series,

358
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:42,706
what a coincidence.

359
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:45,308
But he has been painting, I think,

360
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,445
since he was born.

361
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:49,812
He was about 12 years
old before he realized

362
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:52,133
everybody didn't paint.

363
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:56,787
There we go, just a
little snow over there.

364
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:59,089
We'll just bring that little
bush in the background down.

365
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,025
We're gonna put some sticks and
stuff in these little bushes

366
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:02,592
and they'll show up a little better.

367
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,527
I hope you can see 'em.

368
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:05,730
Alright.

369
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,667
Let's go back to this big old tree.

370
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:13,071
On this side, this is really
an exercise in making trees.

371
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,907
There it comes, there
it comes, there it goes.

372
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:19,609
Think about these old limbs
that hang out here and there.

373
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,312
Now you could just as easy

374
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:25,883
have done this painting
in summer or spring.

375
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:28,719
And put leaves on all these trees.

376
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:29,787
I just decided today,

377
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:34,024
I wanted to do a scene that,
as I mentioned when we started,

378
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:35,192
I like to walk in the woods.

379
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,696
Sometimes when I walk in
the woods in the winter,

380
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:39,663
the sun comes through so strong,

381
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:43,232
and you have this gorgeous effect.

382
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:45,668
I sit down, and I watch
this for a long time,

383
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:48,638
and I kept thinking about
how would I make that?

384
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,209
And how could I do it easy?

385
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,609
I knew how to do it as
a traditional painter,

386
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,912
it's a very time consuming,

387
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:56,881
you have to let things dry between layers,

388
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,918
and put some washes and glazes on there.

389
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:03,187
But I wanted the way

390
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:06,523
where somebody could do this very quickly,

391
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,659
and easily, without all the agony.

392
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,425
And this is what I've come up with,

393
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:13,214
I think it works.

394
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,600
Now this is acrylic paint, as I say.

395
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,370
It dries very rapidly,
it's not very good for

396
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,937
doing wet on wet,

397
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,074
cause you depend on the canvas staying wet

398
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,643
through the entire painting.

399
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:27,511
Doesn't work very well for that.

400
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,914
But for this, where you
need a dry, undercolor,

401
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:33,149
it works great.

402
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,153
I will tell you, there is some controversy

403
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:37,254
in the art world at this time,

404
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:40,624
as to whether putting acrylic under oil

405
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:43,177
is a permanent medium.

406
00:15:44,263 --> 00:15:46,197
I don't know.

407
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:49,182
I really don't know at this point.

408
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,403
I have been talking with some manufacturer

409
00:15:52,403 --> 00:15:53,471
of art products though, and,

410
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:56,541
about the possibilities of
making some other products

411
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,076
that there will be no controversy about.

412
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:02,361
So maybe one day, they'll
have something like that.

413
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,782
Hopefully not too far in the future,

414
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:07,620
cause I like to design new products.

415
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,586
That makes painting easy,

416
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,671
and makes it work for people.

417
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,125
There we are.

418
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,894
I'm fascinated with
machinery and et cetera,

419
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,898
for a long time, in college,
I was an engineering student.

420
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,834
Wanted to be a mechanical engineer.

421
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,188
Instead of building bridges,
I'd rather paint 'em.

422
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,209
A lot of that rubbed off, I think.

423
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,178
I'm gonna take a little bit of that white,

424
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:36,963
put a little touch of the brown into it.

425
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:39,649
Maybe a little black, just to grey,

426
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,418
oh, I like that, just to grey it a little.

427
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,753
I want to grey it.

428
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,786
Lot of color on the brush,

429
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:46,389
don't be afraid of color, a lot of color.

430
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,759
I like sorta hold this
thing like I would a pencil.

431
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,528
So that it's very loose, now then.

432
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:55,566
Touch, and let this dance.

433
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:56,399
Let it play,

434
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
let it pick up that color,

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,702
let it leave its own color,

436
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,339
let all these things
happen, don't fight it.

437
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,807
No pressure.

438
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:06,009
Absolutely no pressure.

439
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,345
There's your light, it's
gonna come across there.

440
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:10,779
No pressure, no pressure.

441
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,016
Here it comes, here it comes.

442
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,619
Just highlight it, with no pressure.

443
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,587
Let me get a little more
black on the brush to grey it.

444
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,357
There we go.

445
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,259
But you need a lot of color on the brush

446
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,895
so when you touch it,
it'll just pull right off.

447
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,630
There.

448
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,000
See that?

449
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,036
Isn't that fantastic?

450
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:32,836
Just with an old filbert brush,

451
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:35,472
you can just about do
this entire painting,

452
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,974
with just an old filbert brush.

453
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,009
Up to you.

454
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:41,479
There we are.

455
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:44,080
I'll have this one come right on through.

456
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,199
But I'm turning the brush
to get all the paint,

457
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,352
and it creates different
effects as it's turning,

458
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:53,056
and wiggling and jiggling.

459
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:54,473
There.

460
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,627
Darker and darker as it comes around,

461
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,230
cause you want this side next to the light

462
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,197
to be the lightest of course.

463
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:02,966
You do that.

464
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,585
There.

465
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:07,837
Look at that.

466
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,607
All we need up here is a big old hoot owl,

467
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:11,674
it'd look like Halloween.

468
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,826
There.

469
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,629
Alright.

470
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:19,116
One of the other shows, I
showed some footage that

471
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,417
I had taken with a great big owl.

472
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,020
In fact it was a great horned owl.

473
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,041
That rascal bit me on the nose, there.

474
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:31,194
Alright, let's do this to
a couple other trees here.

475
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,596
As I say, this whole painting
is mainly just an exercise

476
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,632
in painting trees,

477
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:36,634
but when you get it done,

478
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,536
people will think you
labored over this painting

479
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:40,403
for long periods of time.

480
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:43,140
Shh, don't tell them any different.

481
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,943
Don't tell them any different.

482
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:46,192
There.

483
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:50,063
Just let it go, fall right along the edge.

484
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,500
There we are.

485
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:55,284
Now if you have a lot of time,

486
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:56,288
which we don't here,

487
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,118
but if you have a lot of time,

488
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:58,755
you could take a very thin paint,

489
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:01,592
thin it with paint thinner and

490
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:03,761
put it on the script liner brush.

491
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,428
A little black in there.

492
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:07,730
And using it sidewards,

493
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,769
just pull it down and let it
just graze the high points

494
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,470
here of that brown.

495
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,471
It'll make some gorgeous effects.

496
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:17,423
It does take a little
longer than doing this.

497
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:21,845
Try it, you may like it better than this.

498
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:24,114
If you do, then use it.

499
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:27,852
We want to show you as many
different ways as possible

500
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:29,219
of creating effects.

501
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:33,324
What you create then, is totally
and completely up to you.

502
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:37,427
There, put a little bit over
here on this old monster.

503
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,730
See, but very loose.

504
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,732
Very, very loose.

505
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:44,800
There we are.

506
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,619
Something about like so.

507
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:49,938
Alright.

508
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,343
Let me wipe off the old brush.

509
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:54,878
Little more of the white paint,

510
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,548
and we can just sort of fill this in.

511
00:19:57,548 --> 00:20:00,916
Want this to be very rough looking.

512
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,253
This paint's thick.

513
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,923
In fact, in ways, it looks
like a traditional painting

514
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:08,025
when it's done, you can
go back with glazes.

515
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:10,961
Glazes just made from,
oh, you can make glazes

516
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,730
from something like a
little paint thinner,

517
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,467
a little linseed oil, a little color.

518
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:18,634
Can make all kinds of beautiful glazes,

519
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,771
add a little transparent color to it.

520
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:23,874
You guessed it, (laughs)

521
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,576
I need a big tree.

522
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,611
Lives right there.

523
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:29,412
This tree, I'm gonna
sort put it at an angle,

524
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:33,134
so it looks like it's, maybe
it's bent over a little bit.

525
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:34,851
There we go.

526
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:37,855
Big old legs sticking right out there.

527
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:39,957
Big tree.

528
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:42,608
Big, big tree.

529
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:45,394
Yeah, there he comes.

530
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:47,464
Alright.

531
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:49,682
There.

532
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,000
See, it doesn't matter if you
pick up some of that color,

533
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,470
it makes it look good.

534
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,956
Big old limbs hanging out on him.

535
00:20:57,393 --> 00:21:00,544
Right across that one, we don't care.

536
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:02,180
See, don't be afraid of it.

537
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,648
Do it, enjoy it.

538
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,567
It's what makes it fun.

539
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:10,886
Back to our brush that
has the light color on it.

540
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,904
Come back in here.

541
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:14,290
There, see?

542
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,427
Just let it play and have fun.

543
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,430
There, look at that.

544
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,731
You know, I've got several
letters commenting on

545
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:23,333
this easel that I'm using in this series.

546
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,903
This is a brand new easel
that has just been released.

547
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:29,440
I'm very happy with this easel.

548
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,775
What makes it so great, the top comes off.

549
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,045
If makes a wonderful table top easel

550
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:36,897
with four legs instead
of the traditional three.

551
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:39,149
It's much stronger.

552
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:42,818
It works for this kind
of painting, very well.

553
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:46,088
There, little bit of that white,

554
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:49,208
we can add just a little
white around his foots.

555
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,845
About like that.

556
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,466
There, once again, no pressure,

557
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:58,600
allow that paint just to break on there.

558
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,370
Just allow it to break.

559
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:02,272
Maybe there's a happy little bush

560
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:04,607
that lives right there.

561
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:07,108
Maybe there's another one over in here.

562
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:10,146
Just here and there,
some little bushy things.

563
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:13,700
There, a little touch there.

564
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:17,137
Take a liner brush, put
some paint thinner on it.

565
00:22:18,655 --> 00:22:21,258
There, go right into that brown.

566
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,125
And we can just snatch up a few little

567
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,163
sticks and twigs, here and there.

568
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:28,097
But see, this painting was done with

569
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,767
very, very few pieces of equipment.

570
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,870
Very few colors of paint,

571
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:34,838
there's not a lot to it, it's easy.

572
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:36,972
You can do this one.

573
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:39,741
Even if you've never painted,

574
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:42,278
this is one that you can do.

575
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,314
And your friends and your family,

576
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:46,216
they won't believe you done it.

577
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:47,583
They really won't.

578
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:48,750
In fact, I've had people write and say

579
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,488
their friends actually
started looking for numbers

580
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:53,590
on their painting, like
it was a paint by number.

581
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:56,625
They thought they just
covered the numbers up.

582
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,796
Now you can go back in here,

583
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:01,131
and here and there,

584
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:05,101
put the indication of a few
limbs and twigs and sticks

585
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:06,970
and things, but I don't want
these to be real smooth.

586
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,739
I want them rough, so they follow along

587
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,856
with what's happening in this painting.

588
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:14,211
Very rough, ragged.

589
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:16,613
Wherever you think they should be.

590
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:19,615
Gnarly, I like that world, gnarly.

591
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,417
There we go.

592
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:22,951
See there?

593
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,256
All kinds of hangy-downs.

594
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:28,742
All kinds of 'em, wherever
you think they should be.

595
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,660
There.

596
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,546
Alright.

597
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:38,435
Mmm, yeah that looks like
a Halloween picture to me.

598
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:41,054
And we can put some out in here.

599
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:42,571
And at home, when you do this,

600
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:43,373
take your time.

601
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:45,642
Do a lot of these, they really,

602
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:47,278
all these little hangy down things here

603
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:49,087
are absolutely fantastic.

604
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:50,748
You'll enjoy them.

605
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:52,817
They make your painting
look like, once again,

606
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:55,519
like you spent so much time on it.

607
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,887
And only we know, that it was very easy.

608
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:01,924
There, and if you enjoy success with this,

609
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:03,993
you won't believe what you can do.

610
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:05,394
This just opens doors

611
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:07,396
to a world of art,

612
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:11,150
that'll take you places you've
only dreamed about going.

613
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,568
Alright, tell you what.

614
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,105
Think we about got a finished one here,

615
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,706
let's take a little red,

616
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,409
sign this one, and we'll call it done.

617
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,810
Hope you've enjoyed it.

618
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,812
I'd love to see some
photographs of your work,

619
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:25,382
if you have time, send me a couple.

620
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,049
Let me see what you're doing.

621
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,286
From all of us here,

622
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:30,086
I'd like to wish you happy painting,

623
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:31,954
and God bless, my friend.

624
