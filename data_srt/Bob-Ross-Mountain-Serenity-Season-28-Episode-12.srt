1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:01,638
- Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:02,427
We're certainly glad you could

3
00:00:02,427 --> 00:00:03,195
join us today.

4
00:00:03,196 --> 00:00:04,400
I thought today maybe we could

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,798
just do a fantastic little painting

6
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,099
that I hope you'll enjoy.

7
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:08,677
Let's start out and have them run

8
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:09,883
all the colors across the screen

9
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:11,621
that you'll need to paint along with us.

10
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:12,506
While they're doing that,

11
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:14,277
let me show you what I got done today.

12
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:16,038
I have my standard, old, pre-stretched,

13
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:17,455
double-primed canvas,

14
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:18,960
and I've covered it with just a

15
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,359
very thin coat of liquid white.

16
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,426
So it's all wet and slick,

17
00:00:22,426 --> 00:00:23,611
and it's ready to go.

18
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,855
Let's just have some fun today.

19
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,877
Today, let's start with
a little tiny brush,

20
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:30,180
the two-inch brush.

21
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,242
We'll take a small amount
of Alizarin Crimson.

22
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,958
We don't need much, just a little

23
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,510
Alizarin Crimson. Just tap a little

24
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,085
in the bristles.

25
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:39,908
There we go,

26
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:41,850
and let's go right up in here.

27
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,314
We'll put a little bit
up in the sky today,

28
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:47,118
somewhere delicate, just want to

29
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:49,231
warm it up. Be very careful.

30
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:52,856
In a heartbeat, you can
set the sky on fire.

31
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:55,896
All we want to do is warm it a little.

32
00:00:55,896 --> 00:01:00,728
There we go, something about like so.

33
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,418
That's all we need.

34
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:04,045
Maybe a touch more of that,

35
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:05,699
and we'll have a little water,

36
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:06,414
down here at the bottom.

37
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:09,079
I'll put a little bit
down here at the bottom.

38
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,477
Maybe a little of that pinkish color

39
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:13,100
will reflect right into the water.

40
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,468
If we don't have water,
we'll just cover it up.

41
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:18,465
No big deal because in our world,

42
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:21,431
we can do anything that we want to do.

43
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,126
Alright, in that case, let's go

44
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,783
into a little bit of the Phthalo Blue.

45
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:26,870
Once again, don't need much,

46
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,217
and it don't even have to clean the brush.

47
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:31,447
The Phthalo Blue is so much stronger

48
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:32,362
than the Crimson, it'll just eat it up.

49
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:35,198
Let's go back up in here.

50
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:37,748
I'm just gonna make little X's,

51
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:39,444
little criss-cross strokes,

52
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:40,936
something like that.

53
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:43,091
Go all the way across the top.

54
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:46,995
Bring it down til it
almost touches the crimson.

55
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:49,064
Once again, the blue is so much stronger

56
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:51,933
if you're not careful it'll
just eat all the crimson up.

57
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:54,951
There, about like so.

58
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:56,563
While I still have that brush going,

59
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:58,206
I'm gonna take a little Prussian Blue,

60
00:01:58,206 --> 00:01:59,763
which is much darker, and just add

61
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:02,995
to the corners on each side.

62
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:05,128
Something like that,

63
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:07,260
and, once again, while I have the blue

64
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,097
on the brush, I'm gonna go down

65
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,562
and put a little bit down here.

66
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:14,066
If I'm gonna have water, we need

67
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,409
a little blue down there,

68
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:18,449
something about like that.

69
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,657
There we go.

70
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,939
It really doesn't matter
because we'll change it

71
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,283
in any direction that we want

72
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:26,747
when we get there.

73
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,137
There, alright, and now, the most fun part

74
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:30,640
of the whole procedure.

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,330
Let's clean the brush.

76
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,290
We wash our brushes, as you know,

77
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,933
with odorless paint thinner,

78
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:39,045
and I really, really recommend that

79
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,858
it's odorless or you'll become

80
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,457
the most unpopular person

81
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:44,713
in the whole house.

82
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,356
If you do that in the living room,

83
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:50,316
you're going to become unpopular too.

84
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:51,686
Get your little brush beater rack

85
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,457
that you put down in the garbage can

86
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,079
to contain all that.

87
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,884
There we go.

88
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:00,368
I do it here in the studio
because they pick on me.

89
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:02,533
It's a way of getting even with them.

90
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,570
There we are,

91
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,420
and besides that, it's a lot of fun.

92
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,514
Okay, very gently, just
blend the entire sky,

93
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:13,364
and take out the little brush strokes.

94
00:03:13,787 --> 00:03:15,807
Same thing here in the water.

95
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:17,897
We're just gonna blend it a little bit.

96
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:21,402
See that little bit of
pink is still there.

97
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,097
It shows right through,

98
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,701
and that's exactly what we wanted to do.

99
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,478
Alright, let's have some fun.

100
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:30,575
Let's take- I've got several of these

101
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:31,950
two-inch brushes going- I want to

102
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,158
take one and tap it, tap right

103
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,519
into the Titanium White.

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,449
Show you a simple, simple little way

105
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,956
of making a happy little cloud.

106
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,789
All we're gonna do is just take

107
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:46,489
and tap in a little, basic shape.

108
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,061
We don't care, just tap it, there.

109
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,186
This is the easiest way I've ever found

110
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:57,163
of making very effective clouds.

111
00:03:57,163 --> 00:04:00,736
Just tap, but you do have to put in

112
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:02,804
basic shape. You can't just tap it random,

113
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:05,838
and a cloud appears, there.

114
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,959
Think about basic shape.

115
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,346
Now, this old cloud could float

116
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:14,484
around and just have a good time all day.

117
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:17,663
Maybe, maybe something about like here.

118
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,170
It doesn't matter.

119
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:23,795
A clean, dry brush and very gently,

120
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:27,528
very, very gently, one herrance of air,

121
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,161
we can just blend this rascal

122
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:31,367
until it's as soft as you want it to be.

123
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:36,367
It's that easy, that easy, alright.

124
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,975
We've got some happy little clouds

125
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:42,577
that just live up here in our sky.

126
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:46,198
Okay, great, there.

127
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:48,615
If you just have a little
paint on your brush,

128
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:49,980
you can just beat it like that.

129
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,911
It'll take the paint off,

130
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:52,742
and it's easier than going through

131
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:54,742
the whole cleaning procedure.

132
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,923
Let's make us a little mountain.

133
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,355
For that, I'm gonna
take some Prussian Blue,

134
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:01,423
some black, a little brown in there too,

135
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:04,089
a little Van Dyke, some Crimson,

136
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,161
maybe a little more of the Crimson.

137
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,819
Just mix them up.

138
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,728
Cut off a little roll of paint,

139
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,491
should lay right on
the edge of your knife.

140
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:18,116
Let's decide, in our world, maybe way,

141
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:21,625
up in here, there's just a happy little

142
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,088
mountain lives way up here.

143
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:26,242
We don't care, however you want it to be.

144
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,591
That's the way it should be.

145
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:34,591
There we are, something like so.

146
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:37,507
I'm scraping off all the excess paint,

147
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:42,507
all of it. What's left is exactly right.

148
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:46,262
It's absolutely perfect, there.

149
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,236
I'll take the two-inch brush, grab it,

150
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:49,207
and just pull.

151
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,209
That does two things.

152
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,737
Most important, it removes excess paint

153
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:55,425
so the next layer goes on much easier.

154
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,985
Secondly, it blends the paint down,

155
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:00,929
so it looks misty down at the base.

156
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:04,320
That's exactly what
we're looking for today.

157
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,689
We can wash the old brush,

158
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:11,689
just want to wash the brush, there.

159
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,824
I'll say, that's really the most fun part

160
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:17,415
of this whole procedure.

161
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,997
Let's take some Titanium oil

162
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:23,133
and put the least little
touch of Bright Red in it

163
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,873
and maybe even a little
bit of the Midnight Black.

164
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:28,679
I want to gray it and warm it.

165
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:30,630
Don't over-mix it.

166
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,401
Leave that marbled,

167
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,526
all those little designs
will stay right in there.

168
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:37,894
Okay, let's go up in here.

169
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:40,037
Little roll of paint, and we touch.

170
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,662
We just follow the angle of the mountain.

171
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:46,074
Follow it, follow it, see?

172
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,625
Follow right along, just like that.

173
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,086
That's all there is to it.

174
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:53,338
No pressure though,
absolutely no pressure.

175
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:56,079
Let the knife float.

176
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,074
I've said it over and
over in other series,

177
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,450
but when I was teaching my son, Steve,

178
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,882
to paint, I used to tell him,

179
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:03,088
"If you just pretend that he was a

180
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:05,434
whisper, and he floated
across the mountain,"

181
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:08,314
and it's sort of a good analogy.

182
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:11,610
He understood, and today, today,

183
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,751
that little rascal makes the best

184
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,001
mountains in the industry.

185
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,415
Alright, now that I've
taken a little white,

186
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:21,369
a little touch of the Prussian Blue,

187
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,428
made a little shadow color,

188
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:26,009
and, with that, we'll
come right up in here,

189
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,629
and we'll put the indication of some

190
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,257
happy little shadows that
live in our mountain.

191
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:33,230
Right along in here, once again.

192
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,294
Absolutely no pressure, no pressure.

193
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:42,028
Just let it sort of float.

194
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,353
When you have this much power,

195
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:45,719
you've got to make decisions.

196
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,549
Maybe right here, yep, you're right.

197
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:53,036
See, here's another little peak,

198
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:55,286
and maybe it comes right
around here somewhere.

199
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:58,347
I don't know, don't know
that we really care.

200
00:07:58,348 --> 00:07:59,905
I just want to show you how to do it,

201
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:03,403
and you decide where they live.

202
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:04,726
Back to our shadow color.

203
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,229
Each little highlight needs its own

204
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,292
individual shadow. It won't play with you.

205
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,426
It'll just go home.

206
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:15,754
Give each one a shadow.

207
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:19,584
Maybe it sort of bends over like that.

208
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,112
It's your world, and, in your world,

209
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:25,739
you can do anything that you want.

210
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,871
Clean, dry two-inch brush. We'll create

211
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,984
a little bit of a mist up here,

212
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:32,841
just by tapping.

213
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,581
Pay very close attention to the angles,

214
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,970
and follow them. Lift upward.

215
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,274
Takes out the little tab marks, sort of.

216
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:43,283
Sort of blends it all together, that easy.

217
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:45,609
There we are.

218
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,838
Once again, just blend it.

219
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:51,944
Angles are most important
though, most important.

220
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:56,945
Sometimes, let's get crazy, sometimes,

221
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:01,565
I like to paint like a
big ridge of mountains

222
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:04,115
that lives underneath one mountain.

223
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:07,603
It's striking, so we'll
have a little ridge

224
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,076
that comes right down through here.

225
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:11,176
We don't know where it goes.

226
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,514
Maybe it goes on over here somewhere.

227
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,188
Oh, I'll probably put some trees there,

228
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:20,347
so don't worry about it.

229
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:23,409
You know me, I alway
have to have a big tree.

230
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:27,035
So I'll probably have a tree there.

231
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:28,838
Put a little paint on.

232
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,142
Grab two-inch brush and pull it,

233
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:34,300
the same as we did before. Pull it.

234
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:37,594
Really get in there and grab it.

235
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:39,867
That pulls that paint down

236
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,405
and removes excess paint.

237
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:47,405
There, something about like that.

238
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:50,554
We don't care where it goes.

239
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:53,263
There we are.

240
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:56,826
Now, we'll take, once
again, I'm putting a little

241
00:09:56,826 --> 00:10:00,836
black with the white to gray it.

242
00:10:00,836 --> 00:10:03,898
Just a little.

243
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:08,898
A small roll of paint and no pressure.

244
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,887
No pressure. I'm using
less paint on this one.

245
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:14,392
A lot less paint just
barely, barely touching it.

246
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:17,348
I just want the indication here.

247
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,086
Think where light would hit.

248
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:19,854
This mountain says our light's coming

249
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,947
from the right, so pay attention

250
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:25,219
to where light would strike.

251
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:28,750
Think about it in your mind.

252
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,418
Just think about it. Just let it go.

253
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:36,845
No pressure at all, none whatsoever.

254
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,317
I know you get tired of hearing that,

255
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:40,236
but it's so important,
and I get letters everyday

256
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:41,868
from people who say, "I'm
still having a little

257
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,863
problem with the mountains."

258
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:47,554
99 times out of 100,
it's one of two problems.

259
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:52,448
The paint is too thin.
The paint is too thin,

260
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:54,080
and it, as Steve, my son, said,

261
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:57,557
just mushes together, and you have mud.

262
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,652
Or you're applying too much pressure.

263
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:05,652
One or the other. One or the other. There.

264
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:07,818
Once you get the pressure thing down,

265
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:11,146
then it's easy. Then it's so easy.

266
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:12,747
I get letters everyday, as I say,

267
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:13,972
from people all over the world,

268
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,415
fantastic friends, and they tell me

269
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,177
they never believed they could paint,

270
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,201
and they're doing paintings now

271
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,260
that friends and relatives absolutely

272
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,798
don't believe. I bet some of them tell me

273
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:27,742
that the friends start looking real close

274
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:29,119
and start trying to find the numbers.

275
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,551
They think they're paint-by-number.

276
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:33,439
They never believe that their friend

277
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:37,310
had that kind of talent,
but you can do this,

278
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:40,628
you really and truly can do this.

279
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:41,609
There we go.

280
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:45,001
I have youngsters in their 90's tell me

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,688
that they wanted to
paint their entire life.

282
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:50,781
Now, they're doing it.
Now, they're doing it.

283
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:53,267
If you can do this, you can do anything

284
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:57,693
that you believe you can
do, anything, anything.

285
00:11:57,692 --> 00:11:59,068
I know you can do it, and if I know,

286
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:02,919
you certainly do, there. Alright.

287
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,849
That's all I want there,
just the indication

288
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,913
of some nice cliffs or something there

289
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:11,346
underneath that big mountain.

290
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:15,366
There we go. I'm just gonna lift this up

291
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:18,033
and blend this together,
something like so.

292
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,796
I want this to be very soft at the base,

293
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:25,796
very, very soft. Alright.

294
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,393
Shoot, you're doing okay there.

295
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:31,173
Pretty nice looking mountains we made

296
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:32,751
in just a few minutes.

297
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,663
How long will it take?

298
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,092
I'm going to take some
of that mountain color,

299
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:40,492
add a little white to it.
I want to lighten it up

300
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:45,004
a little bit, about like that.

301
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:49,302
Maybe, I'll clean the knife here.

302
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,275
I'll get a fan brush.

303
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:53,591
Maybe, in our world, way back,

304
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:55,479
under this mountain, maybe there's

305
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,473
an indication of a few old trees

306
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:59,371
that are far away. We can't make out

307
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:02,645
a lot of detail in these trees.

308
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:04,224
These trees are too far away to have

309
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:07,595
a lot of detail. So
don't spend a lot of time

310
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,729
trying to put every leaf on these.

311
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:13,355
It will ruin the illusion
of distance if you do.

312
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:15,562
When things are far away, you see shape,

313
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:20,562
basic color, and that's all. There.

314
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,455
Now we take a two-inch brush. Tap it.

315
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:28,456
Tap it severely right on
the bottom and lift up.

316
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:30,577
I tapped it down here only to create

317
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:35,143
the illusion of mist,
a little bit of mist.

318
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:41,029
You know me, I'm crazy about trees.

319
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,021
So I thought, now, maybe today

320
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,552
we'd do a few trees. Why not?

321
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:49,990
Let's take Prussian Blue, Phthalo Green.

322
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,894
I like Phthalo Green in
my evergreens sometimes.

323
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:56,260
A little Van Dyke, some Crimson,

324
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,906
and we'll just mix all those together,

325
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:01,274
all of them together.

326
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,341
I might as well mix up a pretty good

327
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,893
pile of paint. Wipe off the knife.

328
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:09,476
I just wipe the knife
on an old paper towel.

329
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:12,953
There we go. Let me find an old fan brush.

330
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,574
Hey, there's one.

331
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:17,455
I've got too many brushes going here.

332
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,108
I'm gonna load it full of paint,

333
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:21,517
both sides, a lot of color.

334
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:23,288
Okay, let's go up in here.

335
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:24,985
Big decision time.

336
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:27,950
We have a tree; we do have a tree.

337
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,766
It lives right there now.

338
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:33,134
Just use the corner of
the brush to start out.

339
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:35,970
As you work down the tree,
push harder and harder.

340
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,089
Really smush it in, once again,

341
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:43,089
as Steve says. He's quite a character.

342
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,533
I think he's almost 27 years old now,

343
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,272
and he's painted his entire life.

344
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:51,557
That's all he's ever known,

345
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,022
and I'm so proud of him.

346
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:56,550
He is a character, a little short guy;

347
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:01,549
he's nearly 6'6" now, calls me Shorty.

348
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:07,052
There, a little touch here.

349
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:11,150
Steve is so accomplished
at what he's doing,

350
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,572
him and my dear friend, Damon Jester,

351
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,427
they travel around and
they teach instructers

352
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:18,073
how to instruct.

353
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:21,668
Plus, we have a couple of
other people that do it.

354
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:24,132
There, but at his young
age, he's practiced

355
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,477
enough already that him and Damon

356
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:29,176
teach people how to instruct.

357
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:30,307
So we have teachers running loose

358
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:32,557
all over the country.

359
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,000
There, gotta spread the joy.

360
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,901
Okay, we'll have another one right there.

361
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:40,387
Add another one right there.

362
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,799
There we go. Wherever.
This is your forest.

363
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,103
You can make it any way you want it.

364
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:49,879
Sometimes, you can just
do something like this,

365
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,409
and, because we don't worry
about detail at the base,

366
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:56,342
only where they stand as individuals,

367
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:58,315
down here you can care less.

368
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:02,348
We'll separate that with highlights.

369
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,854
You don't even have to worry down here.

370
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:07,084
All you're worried
about is some nice tops.

371
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:11,040
See? We just made a forest
right there. That easy

372
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,801
We'll come back with a little light green,

373
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:17,801
and we'll just highlight
those little rascals. Easy.

374
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:21,895
Okay, I like bigger trees.

375
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,716
We are gonna have a forest here.

376
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,345
And, when you're painting, I'm not having

377
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:27,351
too much trouble here,
but, when you're painting,

378
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:28,833
if when you go over a mountain like this

379
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,932
or something, you have a hard time

380
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:32,109
making it stick, dip the brush

381
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,942
into a little bit of paint thinner.

382
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:36,502
Then go through your color.

383
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,964
It'll thin the paint just enough

384
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,500
that you can go right over the top

385
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,999
of that other without it
mixing together so bad.

386
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:46,743
Alright, we said we was
gonna have a big tree here,

387
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:50,528
so I think we should do that.

388
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:55,528
Here we are, a big old tree,

389
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:58,677
and, once again, down here, we don't care.

390
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:00,320
We really don't care because I'm going to

391
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,579
fill this up full of trees.

392
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:04,106
I want a whole forest out here

393
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:08,469
in front of this beautiful mountain.

394
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:10,211
There, and maybe I'll have one more

395
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,241
right here, just to cover up that hole

396
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,816
we got left. We're in business.

397
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:18,365
Now, you can fill this up here

398
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:20,996
with a paint roller. It doesn't matter.

399
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:22,746
It doesn't matter.

400
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:26,511
Just quickly drop in some stuff.

401
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,928
In fact, I could've painted these with

402
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:29,582
one or two-inch brush and been

403
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:34,582
a little faster. Now
then, I'll tell you what,

404
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,839
let's see something here.

405
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,535
Let's take, let's take, yeah.

406
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:42,446
Let's just bring this together

407
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,087
down here on the bottom

408
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:46,845
like water.

409
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:52,875
There, just bring them together.

410
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:55,446
This is our world, so we can do anything

411
00:17:55,446 --> 00:18:00,446
we want to here, anything we want to do.

412
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:05,099
There we go, and maybe, in our world,

413
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,817
maybe a little of this is reflected

414
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,121
right down into the water.

415
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,182
Yep, you're right.

416
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:14,565
Just pull a little bit straight down.

417
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:17,008
It's important that it
comes straight down.

418
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:20,602
I'm trying to save a little bit of pink.

419
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:24,463
And go across. Isn't that easy? That easy.

420
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:29,081
Have instant reflections.
Yeah, I like that.

421
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:32,303
Now then, this is the little fan brush

422
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:33,700
that had the tree color on it.

423
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,556
I just went into some Cad Yellow,

424
00:18:35,556 --> 00:18:37,390
Yellow Ochre, and I'll
hit the Indian Yellow

425
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,325
any minute here.

426
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,967
Because it had blue and black in it

427
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,898
when I touched this, it turned green.

428
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:44,454
So I take a little of
that and put it in there,

429
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:47,120
it turns beautiful green.

430
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:50,791
Let's go up in here, and,
with that color, now,

431
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,326
we can come back in here

432
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:55,132
and begin picking out the highlights.

433
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:56,988
Yeah, once again, if it
doesn't stick too well,

434
00:18:56,988 --> 00:19:00,219
and mine's not, add a
little paint thinner.

435
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:01,563
See, now, watch the difference.

436
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:03,792
A little paint thinner
and I just pull the brush

437
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,551
back through the color.

438
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:07,578
That thinned it out, and now it just sets

439
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:12,578
right on top of that. There.

440
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,200
The brush goes away, I'm just loading

441
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,200
a little more color on it, that's all.

442
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:22,178
Now, I like to keep my
evergreens very dark

443
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,811
toward the base because that way,

444
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,288
it looks to me like there's
big shadows down there.

445
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:31,233
I like to keep evergreens
pretty dark period.

446
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,845
To me, they're darker than trees

447
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:36,439
with leaves on them. It's an individaul

448
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:41,439
thing. The only rule
here is that you enjoy,

449
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,096
and it makes you happy.

450
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:46,977
If it does that, it's
perfect, it's perfect,

451
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,764
couldn't be any better,
no matter what you do.

452
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:55,477
There. In painting, you
will continually grow.

453
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:58,219
Every painting is a learning experience.

454
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,470
You know, in your heart, that your next

455
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,400
painting is gonna be better.

456
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,067
I tell our instructors all the time

457
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,433
I hope they're plagued their entire life

458
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:10,964
with dissatisfaction. I
know that sounds horrible,

459
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:12,447
but as long as you're not satisfied

460
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:16,074
with what you do, then you
go back and you try it again.

461
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:18,932
You do it better and better and better.

462
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:21,299
I hope you have the same disease.

463
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,177
I hope every painting that you do,

464
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:24,436
you look at it, and you say,

465
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:26,750
"I could do better," because you can.

466
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,660
You learn from every painting.

467
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,721
Every painting is a learning experience.

468
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:33,491
Everything in life is
a learning experience.

469
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:34,856
It is not failure.

470
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:37,693
If it doesn't work the way you
want it, it is not failure.

471
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:40,478
It just means you learned something.

472
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:42,803
As long as you're learning,
you're not failing.

473
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:45,117
Let's take a little on the two-inch brush,

474
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:46,951
a little of that same green, yellows,

475
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:50,087
maybe a little bright red here and there.

476
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:52,807
Tap and let's go up in here.

477
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:56,817
Maybe in our world, see, maybe this is a

478
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:59,164
beautiful little grassy area back here.

479
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:00,230
It's one of them places you'd like to

480
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,513
take your shoes off in, and let your feet

481
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:06,384
run naked through there. Phew, nice.

482
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:09,596
Nice, I like little meadows.

483
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:12,796
There, you need some dirt down here.

484
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:14,726
You take a little brown and Dark Sienna

485
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:18,182
mixed together, and
we'll put the indication

486
00:21:18,182 --> 00:21:22,682
of some soil, dirt, whatever
you want to call it.

487
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:27,682
There. I like that. Just a
little, little brown and white

488
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:31,536
mixed together to make a highlight.

489
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:33,648
There. Just a little. I'm
going to bring some grass down,

490
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:37,221
so it doesn't matter,
a little over the shoe.

491
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:40,292
A little over the shoe.

492
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:44,867
Okay, grab me a one-inch brush

493
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:47,598
and dip it into a little
bit of liquid white

494
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,170
just to dim this color,
get some Sap Green,

495
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:53,888
some yellow, more of the Sap Green there.

496
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,876
Phew, nice color. Pull
that brush in one direction

497
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:58,860
to load it, then turn it over,

498
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,111
so the round corner is at the top.

499
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,172
Let's go up here. With
that round corner up,

500
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:07,915
now we can touch, push, bend very gently

501
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:09,740
and create the illusion of all kinds of

502
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,207
little bushes and trees
and happy little things.

503
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,854
They live here. They
live here in our world.

504
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:19,265
A little Yellow Ochre,
maybe a little touch

505
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:21,784
of the Bright Red, right on the end

506
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:23,771
to make a little flower
that lives out there.

507
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,344
Sneaky, huh? Another little bush.

508
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,337
He lives there. I know him. I know him.

509
00:22:29,337 --> 00:22:33,926
He's my friend. He's my friend.

510
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:38,926
He's my friend. There. I know.

511
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:41,009
Painters are a little weird. Go out

512
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,567
and make friends with bushes and trees,

513
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:47,567
but that's okay. That's okay.

514
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:53,616
Whatever it takes. Now, back
to the old two-inch brush.

515
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:55,537
We'll come right along in here

516
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:56,497
and put in some more of that

517
00:22:56,497 --> 00:23:00,144
soft grassy area. There.

518
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:02,511
Just a little here and there.

519
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:05,967
Wherever you think that it should be.

520
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,481
Bring them together. The more you tap,

521
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:11,311
the softer they'll become
until it looks like

522
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:13,977
velvet laying out here, or silk.

523
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:17,349
You can do that. You really can do that.

524
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:22,348
A little bit of liquid white
and we can come right in here,

525
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:25,636
add a little water line indication.

526
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,683
This is just a light
area between the darks,

527
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:32,683
that's all. Just a little
light between the dark.

528
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:38,944
Alright. Wherever. Something like that.

529
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:46,933
Now, sometimes it's fun, we get crazy.

530
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:49,091
I want to take the old one-inch brush

531
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,173
and maybe, over here, on this side,

532
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:54,839
there's a little bush
that lives right here.

533
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,377
We'll just drop in some dark

534
00:23:57,377 --> 00:24:00,342
so we'll have something
for our light to show on.

535
00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:04,182
There we go. Get our
brush that has our green,

536
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:06,967
Sap Green, and the yellow on it.

537
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:10,657
Let's just pop in a happy
little bush right here.

538
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:13,345
This bush sits on this side of the water

539
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:15,350
and watches everything happen.

540
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:19,360
There we are. Okay, a little touch more

541
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:22,240
right in there, shoot.

542
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,326
Well, I better get that
rascal where we want it.

543
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:30,507
I'll tell you what, I think
that one's about done.

544
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:32,224
I'm gonna take a little bit of red,

545
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,783
and we'll sign that one, call it finished.

546
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:36,618
Hope you've enjoyed this little painting.

547
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:39,006
It'll give you experience
with all the equipment,

548
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:42,186
and if you can do this
one, you can do anything.

549
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:45,342
From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting.

550
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:47,337
God bless, my friend.
