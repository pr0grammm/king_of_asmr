1
00:00:01,038 --> 00:00:03,004
- Hello, glad to see you again.

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,134
Thought today we'd do a picture

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,071
that's right straight out of Alaska.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,690
We'll do one of Mount McKinley,

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,083
the most almighty mountain in
the North American continent.

6
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:14,052
And we'll start off today,
and we use just a little bit

7
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:16,443
of Prussian blue, maybe
a touch of phthalo green

8
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:18,142
mixed with it here.

9
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:21,859
And let's dance in some basic shapes here.

10
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,789
I've already put the
Magic White on the canvas

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,326
to save a little time.

12
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:29,552
So we're just literally
mixing color right here

13
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,801
on the canvas, just let this brush

14
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,966
dance and play and have fun.

15
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:37,368
And all we're looking for is general basic

16
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:38,649
cloud shapes here, we're really not

17
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,632
trying to put anything in.

18
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,493
Just let it happen.

19
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:46,411
Just move the brush,
keep it moving, working,

20
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,603
playing, having fun, there we go.

21
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,552
Isn't that something?

22
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:51,635
There we are.

23
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:57,471
Put a nice little cloud shape
right there, what the heck.

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,387
Okay, keep the brush
moving, don't let it stop.

25
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,365
And sometimes brush is lazy, you have to

26
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:08,908
really push it a little
or it'll quit on you.

27
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:10,575
Make it keep moving.

28
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:16,016
Okay, now we'll take
the almighty brush here,

29
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:17,489
and we're gonna swirl this.

30
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,017
We're gonna pull the color, move it,

31
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:23,470
pull it, there we go.

32
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:26,831
Try to avoid a pattern, we
want this to go everywhere.

33
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:29,558
We're looking for a sky
here that has life in it,

34
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,505
has movement in it, we don't want a sky

35
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:33,705
that looks like at night
you pull the curtain down

36
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:35,871
and everything went black on you.

37
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,371
Wanna keep this moving, there.

38
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:41,573
Already you're beginning to see

39
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:45,563
all the little things happening up here.

40
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,396
Every which direction.

41
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,150
Every way, there we go.

42
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:55,525
Now you can blend this too
much and take it all out.

43
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:58,980
We don't wanna take it out,
we just wanna mix it up.

44
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,897
Stir it up.

45
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,562
Okay, while we've got some
paint on the brush here,

46
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,729
we'll add a little more
Prussian blue and phthalo green.

47
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:15,384
And we'll put us in some water.

48
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,717
We pull from the outside in.

49
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,096
And leave a little area opened here,

50
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:24,462
that will create the little sheen of light

51
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,794
that plays across the water.

52
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,675
You can go back with white
paint and put it back in,

53
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:32,599
but you've already covered
the canvas with Magic White,

54
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:34,098
so why not use it?

55
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:38,099
This is a lazy man's way of painting.

56
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:42,915
You let the paint work,
you let the brushes work.

57
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:46,497
Use what happens
naturally, don't fight it.

58
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:54,203
Okay, clean the old brush off,

59
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:57,683
and let's get out an
almighty fan brush here.

60
00:02:57,683 --> 00:03:01,036
And let's build some happy
little clouds up here.

61
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:04,949
I'm gonna take titanium white
with the least little touch

62
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:06,866
of permanent red in it.

63
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:12,202
And load the brush full of
paint, just really load it up.

64
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:14,598
Now we'll start working on
some basic cloud shapes here,

65
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:16,924
and we'll dance in all these little areas

66
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:19,675
and let 'em just play in the sky.

67
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:24,641
Keep the brush moving, keep it moving.

68
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,715
You want areas that are
thick, areas that are thin.

69
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:32,632
Let all these little things happen.

70
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:35,930
And we'll take the big brush here

71
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:39,104
and gently, gently blend this together.

72
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:40,187
Very lightly.

73
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:45,128
And fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.

74
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,061
And right there you've
got an almighty cloud,

75
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,394
just that quick.

76
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,967
But they're very easily
killed, clouds are delicate.

77
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,530
Don't overwork it, put
it in, leave it alone.

78
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,117
Okay, and maybe we'll
have another one here.

79
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:03,200
We'll put a, layer these clouds some.

80
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,114
Okay.

81
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:14,281
Nature is so beautiful, just
let it go, have fun with it.

82
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,216
Very, very easy to work these to death.

83
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,841
Okay, we'll blend this in.

84
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:31,458
And you work in layers here, you do thing

85
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,936
that's the farthest away first,

86
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:37,352
have him finished, and then work forward.

87
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,793
There, we'll hypnotize that one,

88
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:44,127
blend this one a little bit.

89
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,132
Okay, little bit more red here.

90
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,823
There we go.

91
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:55,638
Don't wanna set these clouds on fire now.

92
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:59,689
All we wanna do is have a
slight warmish glow to 'em,

93
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:02,773
like the sun's playing along the top.

94
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,021
There we go.

95
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,542
Guess we better not forget
this side of the sky.

96
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,578
We'll put a little something over here.

97
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,745
Just some nice little clouds
playing around in the sky.

98
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,559
Okay, and mix these up a little bit.

99
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,642
(lively piano music)

100
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:37,292
Okay, maybe a little
streaky one right here.

101
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,551
Got baby clouds, too.

102
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:41,479
If you didn't have baby clouds,

103
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:43,895
you wouldn't have big clouds.

104
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:49,301
There, and we can work on
this one a little touch.

105
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,470
Okay, there looks like a nice place.

106
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,930
And we're really pushing
this paint into the canvas.

107
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,180
We're working that value
right into the canvas.

108
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,597
Just let it play.

109
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:12,435
Don't kill all the dark areas.

110
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,872
You can end up with great
big cotton balls in the sky

111
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,705
if you're not careful.

112
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:21,658
Guess that'd be considered a UFO,

113
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:24,680
big cotton ball in the sky.

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,430
There, fluff that up.

115
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,432
And work that paint.

116
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,970
And look at there, in
just a couple of minutes,

117
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,137
you have a sky that has so
much action happening in it.

118
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,490
There we go, okay.

119
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,682
(banging)

120
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:52,795
If you do this in your living room,

121
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:55,338
you can redecorate your living
room in a matter of minutes,

122
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:58,549
so be very careful, learn to control it.

123
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:00,212
Have you a box you can
shake your brush in,

124
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,299
and that way you don't have to worry about

125
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:03,965
covering everything.

126
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:09,222
Okay, let's take a little
bit of brown, some blue,

127
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:13,388
a little touch of alizarin
crimson and some white.

128
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:17,901
There we go, and don't
mix your paint dead.

129
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:20,891
Mix it marbley and leave it alone.

130
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:23,912
Okay, now let's do, since
we're gonna do McKinley today,

131
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,440
let's do the basic shape here.

132
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,924
McKinley comes down like
so, has another peak

133
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,752
running right off through here.

134
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,836
Make that just a little more rounded.

135
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,006
There, and we let this side
drop right down and over.

136
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:48,865
All you're looking for
here is the basic outline,

137
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,596
the basic shape of this mountain.

138
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,048
You're not worried at
all what happens in here.

139
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:59,215
Okay, take the big brush,
and we'll pull that down.

140
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,147
This takes off the excess paint

141
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:07,254
and makes the next layer stick better.

142
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,521
And also when you're doing mountains,

143
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,497
if you can see the entire
mountain, the top of the mountain

144
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:15,290
is always more distinct than the bottom.

145
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,102
At the bottom of the
mountain we have mist,

146
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:18,798
and now we have pollution.

147
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,137
We have a multitude of
things that break up

148
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,637
and diffuse light.

149
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:30,698
Okay, and we'll put some snow
on that almighty mountain.

150
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:33,189
Pull that paint out real
flat, just pull it out

151
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,861
and get us a little roll of paint.

152
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,028
And we'll just lay this on and
let it travel right on down.

153
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,850
And you want the paint to break like this,

154
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,634
to make all the little
things that happen in there,

155
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:51,384
the little shadows, the
light and dark areas.

156
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:55,469
Okay, and there's a little bump

157
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:58,923
that comes out right there

158
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,408
and works its way down.

159
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,899
And over here, let this drop just like so.

160
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:16,571
There we go.

161
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:21,860
Now for the shadow
color, we'll use a little

162
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Prussian blue and white.

163
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,247
And once again, don't mix it dead.

164
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:33,079
You want it to be sort of marbley.

165
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:38,144
Okay, now we'll start with the shadows,

166
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,353
and we'll just lay these in here.

167
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:43,104
We wanna bring these
two areas here together.

168
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,040
So we just sorta work it back and forth

169
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,386
and let it come, there you go,

170
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,552
let it just come together.

171
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:56,059
And maybe this shadow comes
right down through here.

172
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:02,721
Every highlight needs
its own private shadow.

173
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:12,231
Okay, we'll put a little
shadow right there.

174
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:14,084
And see how that protrudes that up?

175
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:16,485
Makes it just jump right out at you.

176
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:19,581
The little ridges here and there.

177
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:23,749
All kind of little things
happening in this mountain.

178
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:28,516
And we need a shadow back here
behind this almighty peak.

179
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:29,517
There it is.

180
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,031
Just let him go.

181
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:42,904
Okay, and we want a peak that
comes right up through here

182
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:45,970
and just begins working its way back down.

183
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,052
(lively piano music)

184
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,290
There.

185
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,473
It's a nice ridge coming through here.

186
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:06,371
And we can bring these together.

187
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:09,454
(lively piano music)

188
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,077
A few little shadows in here.

189
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:19,839
Just here and there.

190
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:25,158
Okay.

191
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:30,235
And as we say, we want
this to be more distinct

192
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,975
at the top than the bottom, so we're gonna

193
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:35,096
diffuse the bottom of
it, and only the bottom.

194
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:37,446
And here we're just tapping the canvas.

195
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,809
We're trying not to destroy, only diffuse.

196
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,382
And this is where you really
depend on a firm paint.

197
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:46,605
If you have a loose, oily, thin paint,

198
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,937
you become a mud mixer here.

199
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:55,335
So when you try this at home,

200
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:57,485
if you find that you're
making a lot of mud,

201
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:00,072
check your paint, it
should be very, very firm.

202
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:02,511
Squeeze that tube, it
should stand up maybe about

203
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:05,396
three-quarters of an inch above the tube.

204
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:08,174
Then you have a nice firm paint.

205
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:10,621
Okay, I'm gonna make the same
color and make it darker.

206
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:13,788
Blue, brown, and alizarin added to it.

207
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:17,894
'Cause I want this
mountain to be in front.

208
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:19,889
This is a beautiful study
of how to make one mountain

209
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,557
look very, very big.

210
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,569
And we'll put some
little smaller mountains

211
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,224
here in the foreground.

212
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:29,307
(lively piano music)

213
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:36,435
Okay, another little peak here.

214
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,611
And we'll take the big
brush and pull that out.

215
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:50,528
Son of a gun, this comes right out.

216
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:54,983
That's the beauty of painting wet on wet.

217
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,732
You can move paint on the canvas.

218
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:04,729
And we'll put some happy little snow here.

219
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,229
Just let that run.

220
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
There we go.

221
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:14,295
Okay.

222
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:18,287
Our light is still coming
from the same direction here,

223
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:21,072
so don't let that fool you.

224
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:24,154
(lively piano music)

225
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:34,519
Okay, now we can work
in some shadows here.

226
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:40,687
Let's push that one into the background,

227
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:44,855
just come right on through,
and that'll push him back.

228
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,950
It's scary to have this much power

229
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,283
that you can move mountains.

230
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:02,197
Okay, this, there.

231
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,231
We can swing this around
and bring these two

232
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:07,481
right together.

233
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,340
Just make a nice little ridge out of that.

234
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:18,774
Okay, now we've got an almighty mountain.

235
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,971
I'm gonna take a little
of the blue, brown,

236
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:27,514
alizarin crimson, add a little
touch of sap green to it.

237
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:31,173
Looking for a dark color here, very dark.

238
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:33,014
I will load up this one-inch brush,

239
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:36,296
and we'll push in some
little dark areas here.

240
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,397
This'll be our little
trees that are way, way

241
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,496
back in the distance, bushes and trees

242
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:44,328
and all the little things
happening back here.

243
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:51,038
There we go.

244
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:54,528
Now with the big brush,
we can pull a little bit

245
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,111
of this color down.

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And this'll be the beginning
of our reflections.

247
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,527
Okay, and we'll just give
it a little bit of ripple

248
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:10,444
to make it look watery.

249
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:17,702
(banging)

250
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,336
Okay, let's put some highlights on here.

251
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,442
I'm gonna use a little bit of Magic White

252
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:29,692
mixed with some cad yellow.

253
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:34,663
Little touch of permanent red.

254
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:36,058
And we'll just sorta go back and forth,

255
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:39,808
make a nice orangey
color here, bright color.

256
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,702
Mm.

257
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:48,538
There we go, all these nice little bushes

258
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,011
happening back here.

259
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:53,094
(lively piano music)

260
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,072
And then we'll reflect some of that

261
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:04,654
right down into the water here.

262
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:09,604
There we go.

263
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:14,495
Now with a big brush and
the most delicate, delicate

264
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:18,063
touch possible, just
enough to pull the paint

265
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:21,616
a little bit, we'll pull that down

266
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:25,783
and just give it a watery
effect, don't wanna destroy it.

267
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:29,711
Okay, now let's take...

268
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:36,864
mix up a lot of dark here,
blue, brown, alizarin,

269
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:39,456
and a little bit of sap green.

270
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,538
Should look black to you.

271
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:48,945
And we'll load the brush
full of paint, load it full.

272
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,086
A lot of paint.

273
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,230
And let's make some little evergreen trees

274
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,509
that are growing way back
here in the distance.

275
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,591
(lively piano music)

276
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:06,908
Okay.

277
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:13,876
Let's firm that one up a little bit.

278
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:16,557
It needs to be a little stronger.

279
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:17,557
There we go.

280
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:25,969
Maybe he's got a friend
that lives right over here.

281
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:27,134
Just dropped him in.

282
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:30,218
(lively piano music)

283
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:40,789
Okay, maybe they're
getting a little bigger

284
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,206
as it comes around the curve.

285
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,940
Maybe a little baby one back here.

286
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,903
Okay, we'll put a little
bush in front of him.

287
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:13,505
Okay, we'll take a little
touch of Magic White,

288
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:15,338
a little bit of brown,

289
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,836
and a little touch of yellow

290
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:23,170
just to make a nice sandy looking color.

291
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:29,212
And we'll lay in a little
water line back here.

292
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:36,884
There we go.

293
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:41,830
And we'll cut in a few little trunks

294
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,171
and sticks here and there.

295
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:46,422
(scraping)

296
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:57,438
Okay.

297
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,403
Maybe we need another tree right here.

298
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:07,434
Trees are getting closer,

299
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,288
so they're getting a little bigger.

300
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,813
They look bigger to you, this is the way

301
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:13,479
we push everything back.

302
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,729
Work with perspective here.

303
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,999
Okay, let's move to the
other side of the picture

304
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,788
while we've got a brush
full of paint here,

305
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:32,288
and we'll put an almighty tree right here.

306
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:38,158
These trees live in your brush.

307
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:42,397
You have to scare 'em out
sometimes, really work at 'em.

308
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:45,980
Little son of a guns
will try to avoid you.

309
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:50,920
And they're like everything else.

310
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,773
The first time you try 'em, they're gonna

311
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:54,627
drive you up the wall.

312
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,633
But you practice it.

313
00:19:56,633 --> 00:20:00,145
If there's a secret to
this, it is practice.

314
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:03,263
You learn how to make the brush work,

315
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:05,505
how to touch the canvas with it.

316
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:09,006
And then it's just a matter of practicing.

317
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:13,162
First time you tied your
shoe, it wasn't easy.

318
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,598
You had to look at it and work at it.

319
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:17,016
The next thing you know, you're not paying

320
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:19,912
any attention, you just,
you get your shoe tied.

321
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:20,828
Same thing.

322
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:26,788
Okay, we'll just...

323
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,150
Maybe we'll make another little projection

324
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:35,259
come right out through here, there we go.

325
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,592
A little reflection in here.

326
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:41,548
And we'll pull that down.

327
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:44,632
(lively piano music)

328
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,023
Okay, we'll lay in some more of these

329
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:56,657
pretty colors back here.

330
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:59,907
There's a nice little bush right there.

331
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,359
Mm, there's one.

332
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:13,233
And right down here we'll
reflect some of these.

333
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:25,084
Okay, delicate touch
again, very, very light.

334
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:29,251
Just enough to move it a
little bit on the wet canvas.

335
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:33,568
And we'll put some land out here

336
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,568
so these bushes have a place to sit.

337
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:41,661
Don't want 'em fall off in the river here,

338
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:45,245
so we'll give 'em
something to set on here.

339
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,009
And we can take a clean brush
and just lift that gently.

340
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,517
This is a very thin paint
now, it's mostly Magic White.

341
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:55,025
So you can move that without destroying

342
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,775
what's underneath it.

343
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:01,565
And here we'll use a little bit of just

344
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:03,315
straight Magic White,

345
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:08,506
and we'll put us a happy
little water line in here.

346
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:12,292
There.

347
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:18,005
Okay.

348
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:23,765
Now then, you can, you can put some more

349
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:28,991
little bushes right in here like so.

350
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:36,394
And we'll drop some
reflections into the water.

351
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,291
And we'll pull those down.

352
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,215
And anybody can do this, this
is not some big secret thing.

353
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:51,395
Anybody can do it, we teach
people from the age of 10

354
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:54,807
all the way up 80 and 90 years old.

355
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,974
(banging)

356
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:04,072
And young people really, really like this.

357
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:07,382
They learn it very easily, very quickly,

358
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:10,216
and they see results very quickly.

359
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:14,985
I have a son that's a young man right now,

360
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:16,836
and he was, oh, he's been painting

361
00:23:16,836 --> 00:23:21,002
since he was about 12 years
old, been selling his work.

362
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:27,565
So it's not just for the older person.

363
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:32,400
It will also work very
well for the young person.

364
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,262
The only trouble, like
my son, he's quite lazy.

365
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,327
He'll only paint if he needs money.

366
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:40,598
If he needs money, he'll paint.

367
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:44,765
But it is a nice way to put
a happy buck in your pocket.

368
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,410
And to make good things
happen in your heart.

369
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:54,864
Okay, we'll just have this come
right on down through here.

370
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:55,947
Fill that in.

371
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:06,716
Okay, now we can start
highlighting some of these things.

372
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:10,773
We'll take a little bit of
blue and yellow mixed together,

373
00:24:10,772 --> 00:24:14,727
make a very nice little green color here.

374
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:17,361
And we'll just drop some
highlights on this tree.

375
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:18,864
Remember where your light's coming from.

376
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:21,459
Light's coming from the right,

377
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,024
so you want the right-hand
side of this tree

378
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:27,190
to be a little more distinct
and bright than the left side.

379
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:29,688
And if you're right handed,
you'll probably find

380
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:33,548
it's easier to have the
light coming from the right.

381
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:35,250
If you're left handed,
it will sort of vary

382
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,083
from person to person.

383
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:39,474
Okay.

384
00:24:42,574 --> 00:24:44,250
Let's put some little highlights over here

385
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,084
on these little trees.

386
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:49,773
The sun wouldn't forget them.

387
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:51,793
There we go.

388
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,875
(lively piano music)

389
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,541
There we are now.

390
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:08,277
A little more Magic White,
thin that down just a touch.

391
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:10,955
And we can start finding all
these beautiful little trees

392
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:14,602
and bushes that are living in here.

393
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:17,247
Very important that you don't
kill all this dark area.

394
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:18,101
If you kill all the dark,

395
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,934
your picture's gonna be very flat.

396
00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:23,953
Well, we might as well reflect that

397
00:25:23,953 --> 00:25:26,203
right into the water there.

398
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:29,596
Okay, and there we go.

399
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:33,034
A little bit right in here.

400
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,766
And we'll reflect that right on down,

401
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:38,682
a little touch of red over the top.

402
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:44,452
Okay, there's another nice tree I see.

403
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,339
Little rascals live in your brush,

404
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,673
you just gotta push 'em out.

405
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,140
And let's put a touch
more of the Magic here.

406
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,358
There, nice ochre color.

407
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,175
All these pretty little bushes,

408
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:14,925
just let 'em flow off your brush.

409
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:25,883
And some little grassy areas
coming down through here.

410
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:29,133
Let's turn that into a nice reflection.

411
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:31,066
Just like so.

412
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:37,317
Okay, now let's give him
a little bit of dirt.

413
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:41,271
There we go.

414
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,831
This is straight van dyke brown.

415
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,311
And onto that, we'll take
a little brown and white

416
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:52,455
and give him just a
little touch of highlight,

417
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:54,308
make him look like little stones and rocks

418
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:56,058
playing through here.

419
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,378
Okay, let's put a few little
sticks here and there.

420
00:27:03,378 --> 00:27:04,897
Here we're just cutting through the paint

421
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:08,072
using the point of the knife.

422
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:12,240
But it shows distance, it shows
all these different planes.

423
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,592
Okay.

424
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,220
And we'll put just a little
bit of Magic White under here

425
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,999
and give us a little water line.

426
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:25,082
(lively piano music)

427
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:35,918
There we go, and a few
little sticks over here.

428
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:45,532
Okay, but you see what you
can do in just a few minutes

429
00:27:45,532 --> 00:27:49,199
with an almighty brush
and an almighty knife

430
00:27:50,324 --> 00:27:51,885
and a beautiful painting in your heart.

431
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:54,322
All you have to do is let it out.

432
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:55,823
A few more sticks.

433
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:02,526
There we go, I think
we'll call that finished,

434
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:04,968
and I wanna thank you very,
very much for watching us.

435
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,113
I hope to see you again
in the near future.

436
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:10,279
Until then, happy painting, thank you.

437
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:16,935
(light guitar music)
