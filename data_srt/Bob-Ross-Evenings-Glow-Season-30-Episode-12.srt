1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:01,854
- Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,854 --> 00:00:03,621
I'm certainly glad you
could join us today.

3
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:04,988
I thought today we'd do a painting,

4
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,125
it's very simple, I think you'll enjoy it.

5
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:08,560
Let's start out and have
them run all the colors

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,996
across the screen that you'll
need to paint along with this.

7
00:00:10,996 --> 00:00:12,130
While they're doing that, let me show you

8
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,799
what I've got up here today.

9
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:16,699
I have my plain old 18
by 24 inch double prime

10
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,344
pre-stretched canvas,
and I've just covered it

11
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:20,894
with a very thin coat of liquid white.

12
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:22,472
That's basically all.

13
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:25,243
We use 18 by 24 inch
canvas, but you use any size

14
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:27,378
that you like when you're doing yours.

15
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:29,547
I thought I'd start with
a little, just a little

16
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,216
two inch brush today.

17
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:33,917
I'm going to tap a little
bit of Indian yellow into it.

18
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:36,753
Don't need a lot of color,
something about like so.

19
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:40,390
Let's go up in here, and maybe
right here we'll do that.

20
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,509
That's all there is to it.

21
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,946
Okay, got that one
finished, it's that easy.

22
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,098
I'll go into a little bit of cad yellow.

23
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:49,933
Same way, just use a
little two inch brush.

24
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,902
We don't have to even do anything,

25
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:55,906
just go around the edges
without cleaning it,

26
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,292
touch a little bit of yellow ochre.

27
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,996
There, just working the yellows out here.

28
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:05,634
A little bit more of the yellow
ochre, come right on around.

29
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:07,667
Something about like that.

30
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:10,388
If you put two eyes and a
big smiley face in there,

31
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:12,993
it'd look like little orphan Annie.

32
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,075
There we are.

33
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:16,376
Okay.

34
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:19,180
Sort of blend those together.

35
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:23,935
That's all we're looking for today,

36
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:25,936
something about like that.

37
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:27,371
Still without cleaning
the brush, go and touch

38
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:29,474
a little bit of the alizarin crimson.

39
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:31,709
Don't need a whole bunch.

40
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:34,228
And just begin blending that together.

41
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:37,981
I want to make a sky that
looks like there's a,

42
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,718
maybe the sun's here,
and it's shining out,

43
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:41,603
and it's a beautiful day.

44
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:44,704
We'll do this painting
mostly in brown tones.

45
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:49,109
Sometimes it's gorgeous to do
paintings in just one tone.

46
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:51,379
There we are.

47
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:55,633
Mmm, all right.

48
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:57,402
Now, then, I want to mix up a color.

49
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:59,637
I like brown made from

50
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,941
sap green and alizarin crimson.

51
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:04,091
That's one of my favorite colors.

52
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:06,243
There we are, and I'm going to mix it

53
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,195
a little bit to the reddish side.

54
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:09,764
Just a small amount.

55
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:12,933
Normally we don't worry
about mixing color too well.

56
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:14,319
Today, I want to mix this pretty good,

57
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,655
because I don't want any
green streaks up in the sky.

58
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,875
That ought to do it.

60
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,978
Wipe the old knife,

61
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,382
then we'll go right into
that brown that we made.

62
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:30,126
There, and we'll go up in here,

63
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:32,186
and let's begin using that.

64
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,251
See it?

65
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,338
It sort of matches all this, it sort of

66
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:36,123
works together.

67
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:38,192
It's really a gorgeous brown.

68
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:41,058
All right.

69
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:43,954
And some on the other side,

70
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,067
just right in there.

71
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,403
And then we'll finish the canvas up.

72
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:52,340
We'll just use a little vandyke brown.

73
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:54,807
Little bit on the other side.

74
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,681
And we're ready to wash the old brush.

75
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,100
As you know if you've
painted with me before,

76
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,635
that's really the fun part
of this whole procedure,

77
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:06,304
is just washing the brush.

78
00:03:06,304 --> 00:03:07,673
This is the way, it's the way I get even

79
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:10,223
with everybody here in the
studio that picks on me.

80
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,260
All right.

81
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:18,282
(laughs) You can certainly
change the decor of a room

82
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,706
very rapidly if you're not careful.

83
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:21,887
I suggest when you do this at home,

84
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,908
you get a little device
called a brush beater rack.

85
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:27,491
It fits down in the bottom
of a waste paper basket,

86
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,693
it allows you to do all this without,

87
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:32,296
without ruining a happy marriage,

88
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,799
because you can certainly
do that in a heartbeat

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,218
if you cover the living room with paint.

90
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,752
I'm just blending all
these colors together,

91
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,322
like so.

92
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,593
All right, and then I'm going
to wash the brush again.

93
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,430
I'm really just looking for
excuses to wash the brush.

94
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,700
(laughs) There we are.

95
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,387
Now then, I want to
brighten that a little more,

96
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:59,639
so I'll go right into titanium white.

97
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,576
We just put a little
on the two inch brush.

98
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:04,828
Go right up in here.

99
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,314
Start in the lightest area,
and begin working outward.

100
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,257
We want this to be the
lightest, brightest part

101
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:14,323
of this whole painting, right here.

102
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:16,120
There.

103
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,158
And just begin blending that outward.

104
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,074
Now you can do this several times,

105
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,014
to achieve a desire lightness.

106
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:25,281
You can make it as light
or as bright as you want,

107
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,084
but once you get our here
in these dark colors,

108
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:29,553
I suggest that you clean the brush

109
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,772
before you bring it back into the center.

110
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,576
There we go.

111
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,645
Something about like so.

112
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:39,898
Once again, you can make it

113
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:42,981
as light as you want it
when you do your painting.

114
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,021
Or leave it as dark as you want.

115
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:48,883
It's really an individual thing.

116
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:50,507
Now, very lightly.

117
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,727
I just want to take out the brush strokes.

118
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,605
Now, then.

119
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:57,331
If you want to put the indication,

120
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,784
knock off the excess paint,

121
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:01,752
if you want to put the
indication of a little sun,

122
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:04,187
we can do a little finger
painting right there,

123
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:08,875
and just take your finger
and make a little round sun.

124
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,293
Those square suns sort of bother people.

125
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:12,245
Make it sort of round.

126
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,766
Of course, then, you have
to clean your finger,

127
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:17,085
and you beat it against
the easel the same way.

128
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:19,086
All right.

129
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:22,540
And just barely caress it,

130
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,709
and the indication of a little sun

131
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,528
will remain right there
in your sky, that easy.

132
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:28,932
See there?

133
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,063
It's all you need.

134
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:32,312
Okay, let's have some fun.

135
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:33,717
We're still using the same old brush,

136
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:35,887
a little white, a little
bit of that brown color

137
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:39,875
that we made out of the sap and
the alizarin mixed together.

138
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:44,211
Maybe in our world, way
back in the distance,

139
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:47,015
there's some little foothills
that live back there,

140
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,029
so let's do them.

141
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,201
All you have to do is decide
where they live in your world,

142
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,838
and begin tapping them in.

143
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:55,173
You know, when you paint,

144
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:56,774
tell little stories.

145
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,810
It makes painting easier,
it makes you understand

146
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,627
why things work in your painting.

147
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,781
Shoot, sometimes I get carried away and

148
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,185
maybe talk about the old
trapper that lived in the woods,

149
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:10,365
maybe fell in the river,
just crazy things like that.

150
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,923
But it gives you a reason
for that old, abandoned cabin

151
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:15,026
being there, or something like that.

152
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,362
But make up little stories.

153
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:19,697
I know, I know, you're going to say your

154
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,584
friends and relatives will sort of

155
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:24,001
laugh at you, standing around
talking to yourself painting,

156
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:25,420
but that's okay.

157
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,764
That's okay.

158
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:28,909
Now, then.

159
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,375
I'm going to lift gently upward,

160
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,110
just to make it look like
little trees are growing

161
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,413
on those hills, far away.

162
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:37,598
Short, little strokes,
tiny, little strokes.

163
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:39,459
There.

164
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:40,935
Just a little bit, don't need a lot.

165
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:43,229
Just a little bit.

166
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,741
There we are.

167
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,841
Maybe I'll even take a
little of the titanium white,

168
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,026
I'm going to put the least
little touch of Indian yelllow

169
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,562
in it, and just here and there,

170
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:55,269
touch it a little bit, so
it just stands out a little.

171
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:58,435
You can lighten it up a little.

172
00:06:58,435 --> 00:06:59,706
There, lift upward.

173
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,438
But that's all I'm looking for,

174
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:03,940
just enough to make it
stand out, like the light's

175
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,926
zinging across there.

176
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,377
There.

177
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:08,528
That's all we want.

178
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:09,963
Okay.

179
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:14,302
Now, we'll use this little
number three fan brush,

180
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,939
take a little white, a
little more of that brown.

181
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:21,492
I want to be a little bit darker
than what we have up there,

182
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:23,144
but not a great deal yet.

183
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,264
All right, let's go up in here,

184
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:29,699
maybe there's a little stand of trees

185
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,218
that live right here.

186
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,321
Little group of trees.

187
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:37,125
Happy little family of trees, right there.

188
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,843
I don't know, you decide.

189
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:44,548
In your world, you put trees
wherever you want them,

190
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,233
as many as you want.

191
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:49,069
There, see?

192
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:54,141
And we can come back with
our old two-inch brush,

193
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,044
and we just tap a little bit.

194
00:07:58,696 --> 00:07:59,981
That easy.

195
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,245
And create a whole other
plane in our world.

196
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:06,905
I'm going to lift up,
sort of bring it together,

197
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,321
make it work.

198
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:11,158
That's all there is to it.

199
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:16,721
And back to our white, with a little bit

200
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:18,461
of the Indian yellow in it,

201
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,053
and we can begin just
showing some little dooders

202
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,788
that climb up the hill like this.

203
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:27,425
This'll just show different
planes in your hill,

204
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:28,992
and that's all we're trying to do,

205
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,545
something about like that, lift it up.

206
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:33,715
There.

207
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,366
And maybe over in here, it
just sort of disappears.

208
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,702
We don't know where it goes.

209
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,750
Don't know that we even care.

210
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,889
Doesn't matter.

211
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,423
I'm just going to cover all this up

212
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,826
with that nice brown we made.

213
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:48,763
There.

214
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,048
As I say, I want this painting to have a

215
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:53,699
sort of a brown flavor to it.

216
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:55,918
I love this color,

217
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:59,407
and I like paintings that
are almost monochromatic,

218
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,375
just one basic color.

219
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:03,644
All right.

220
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:06,130
I'll tell you what, sometimes,

221
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,172
sometimes you have to get a little crazy.

222
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,017
Let's take a little bit of that white,

223
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:12,903
and get a little roll of paint,

224
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:14,404
right on the edge of the knife there.

225
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,867
Let's go up in here, and maybe

226
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:18,916
we'll just make the indication,

227
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,562
just by doing this,
that's all you have to do.

228
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:28,386
Just like this, just enough
so that it separates,

229
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:34,057
and we can begin putting
little things like that.

230
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,860
If you just rub that very hard,

231
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,655
and keep it pretty level,
when this is all done,

232
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,000
it'll look like,

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,833
well, watch, it'll look like there's a,

234
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,736
maybe a little river
back in here somewhere.

235
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:46,771
But it's far away.

236
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,522
We don't want a lot of detail in it.

237
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,777
Far, far away.

238
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:52,494
Just something like that.

239
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:55,379
And we'll come along, and we'll

240
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,697
put something in the foreground,

241
00:09:58,315 --> 00:09:59,983
but maybe there's some
little rapids back here

242
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:02,169
that are slowly running over.

243
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,637
And it's just to give an indication.

244
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:08,075
Too far away to have
a lot of detail in it.

245
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,110
All right.

246
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,163
We don't know where it goes back here,

247
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:15,099
don't know that we even care.

248
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,817
Doesn't matter in our world.

249
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,920
Something about like that.

250
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,423
Okay, now.

251
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:27,745
I'm going to grab a clean,

252
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,245
clean two inch brush.

253
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,713
I'm going to take that
same brown that I made,

254
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,149
but this time I'm going
to add a little bit of

255
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:33,450
midnight black to it.

256
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,669
I want to start getting very dark.

257
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,320
We're getting into the foreground now,

258
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,503
and we need to get much darker.

259
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:41,842
But we load it the same
way, scooping here.

260
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,744
Okay, bravery test.

261
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,948
Maybe.

262
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:50,750
Let's put some nice, dark color in here.

263
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:53,551
Very dark.

264
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,673
You need dark in order to show light,

265
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:58,191
and that's all we're putting
this in here for right now.

266
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,196
The only reason we're putting it in here.

267
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,198
There, we'll just make a nice little hill.

268
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:10,303
See, and it pushes all
that back very, very far.

269
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:13,606
That easy.

270
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:18,077
And you can just decide
where you want this to live.

271
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,331
Now, you could really
put this in any old way.

272
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,700
I suggest you practice this tapping,

273
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,754
because we're going to
put grass on top of this,

274
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:28,153
and it gives you a chance
to practice those strokes,

275
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:31,142
and anytime you can practice,

276
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:33,527
it'll make your life so much easier,

277
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,712
and besides that, it's more fun than just

278
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:38,799
painting it on there with a paint roller.

279
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:41,034
All right.

280
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,471
That's coming along pretty good there.

281
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,540
Something about like that.

282
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:48,993
That's really all we're looking for,

283
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,845
it's just a dark area.

284
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,830
Then we'll come back,

285
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,382
begin putting all the beautiful
little lights in there.

286
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:57,951
All right.

287
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,471
This is interesting,
this is the 30th series

288
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:01,739
of "The Joy of Painting."

289
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,892
Shoot, there's nearly 400 shows now.

290
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:08,145
If you hadn't got a chance
to see them all in your area,

291
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,514
give the station you're
watching this on a call,

292
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,822
because they're available to them,

293
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:15,184
and if you'd like to
see them, let them know.

294
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:17,336
That's the only way they
know that you're interested.

295
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:19,558
There we go.

296
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:21,288
Something about like that.

297
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:22,543
Now, then.

298
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,246
Going back to my old two inch brush.

299
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:29,100
I'm going to take some sap green,

300
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,389
a little bit of the cad
yellow, yellow ochre,

301
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:36,389
all those beautiful
little colors, just tap.

302
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,144
Now, then.

303
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:41,484
Back in here, I want the indication

304
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:43,514
of a little bit of grass area,

305
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,017
that lives right along in here.

306
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:48,362
Something about like that, but just tap.

307
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:50,336
All you have to do is tap.

308
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,188
Just tap.

309
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:53,930
You decide.

310
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,777
About like that.

311
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,362
See how you can make
all those little things?

312
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,731
And the more you tap
it, the more it'll mix

313
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,600
with the color that's
already on the canvas,

314
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,287
and it'll get darker and
darker automatically.

315
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,036
Automatically.

316
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,504
You don't even have to worry about it.

317
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:10,375
If you want it to be
bright, don't tap much.

318
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,909
If you want it to be darker,
just get in there and

319
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,942
tap the devil out of it.

320
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:16,197
There.

321
00:13:16,197 --> 00:13:17,481
All right.

322
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:20,600
Now, let's get crazy. (laughs)

323
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:22,309
You've painted with me before,

324
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,920
you know I really like trees.

325
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:27,258
Let's take some vandyke
brown, alizarin crimson,

326
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:29,408
and midnight black, and mix them together.

327
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:32,471
All right.

328
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:34,581
Let me wipe the old knife.

329
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:38,267
Let's grab, I'm using a number
six fan brush this time.

330
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,644
Number three would work
okay, doesn't matter.

331
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,007
Whichever one you happen to pick up.

332
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,657
Load it full of color.

333
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,979
Maybe up here on the
top of our little hill,

334
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:50,682
lives, yeah, you guessed
it, a happy little tree,

335
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:52,099
right there.

336
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,701
I like little trees.

337
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:58,638
They're some of the nicest
people in the country.

338
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,038
There, see?

339
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,009
There he lives.

340
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,865
I don't want him to be lonely.

341
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:07,730
Maybe there's a little family
up here that lives together.

342
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,552
What a magnificent view to set
up here and look at all day.

343
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,919
Mmm, I'm envious.

344
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:17,307
We'll even have a little one right there,

345
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:19,219
then we got a whole family.

346
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:22,028
Three little trees on the hill.

347
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:24,764
Now, then.

348
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:30,288
I just want to scratch in the indication

349
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:32,557
of a little tree trunk here and there,

350
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,341
something about like that.

351
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,178
That's all we need.

352
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:40,831
Take that same brown color,

353
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,532
maybe add a little bit
of the bright red to it.

354
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:44,852
Not much, just a little bright red.

355
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:48,572
There, maybe even a little
touch of titanium white,

356
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,107
just to get it to stand out a little bit.

357
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,426
I don't want a lot of highlights on these.

358
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,578
Yeah, that's plenty.

359
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,379
Just enough so that you get the feeling

360
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,582
there are some highlights.

361
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,567
But they don't distract.

362
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,447
There, this one next.

363
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,524
You have to decide which
tree lives in the foreground,

364
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,274
which tree lives back.

365
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,179
I think this one's right in the front.

366
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,565
So we do him last, so he's in front.

367
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,384
Hope that shows up.

368
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,870
Now, we can go back to our
brush that has that sap green,

369
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,310
a little Indian yellow, all those colors.

370
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,509
All the different greens, so we can begin

371
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,475
bringing this together.

372
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,234
A few little dooders back there.

373
00:15:31,783 --> 00:15:33,277
But isn't that neat?

374
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:36,120
See, got a little family
of trees that sit here.

375
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,304
They look out over this beautiful view.

376
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:41,665
Mmm, it is gorgeous.

377
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,894
I'd like to live in a place,

378
00:15:42,894 --> 00:15:45,649
well, I'll tell you what, why not?

379
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:47,932
If I was going to live
here, I'd need a house.

380
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:50,177
I'm not very good at sleeping on the dirt.

381
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:52,202
So, let's come right up in here,

382
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,137
and let's build us a little,

383
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:55,471
maybe it was a little house there.

384
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,754
We'll just scrape us out a basic shape,

385
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,343
something like so.

386
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:02,693
I want it right in front of these trees.

387
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,515
We'll take a little vandyke,
a little dark sienna

388
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:08,967
mixed together, and
let's just paint this in.

389
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,270
A quick little house.

390
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:14,774
This is just a happy little
house up here on a hill.

391
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:17,878
Like that.

392
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:19,711
There.

393
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,346
Gives us a nice roof.

394
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,250
Got to have a roof to keep the water out.

395
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:30,668
There we go, something like that.

396
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,177
Now, when you do yours, maybe
you want to have a house

397
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:35,613
that's different, maybe you
don't want to have a house.

398
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,815
Maybe you want to have a two story house.

399
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:39,817
You can do that.

400
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,135
Anything that you want to do.

401
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,254
Painting gives one almost total freedom,

402
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,673
at least on this piece of canvas.

403
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,491
A little brown and white,

404
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,077
no pressure.

405
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,680
I want this to be sort
of an old, raggedy house.

406
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:56,783
There.

407
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,838
As we mentioned earlier,
doing stories and stuff,

408
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,471
maybe there's a trapper that lived here,

409
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:03,941
and he went down to the river one day

410
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:07,461
to check his beaver trap,
and maybe he fell in.

411
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:10,762
Who knows?

412
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,484
Now we can do a cabin-ectomy.

413
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,704
In other words, just cut it off.

414
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:18,307
Get it the way we want it.

415
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:19,890
Better have a door in our cabin.

416
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,509
It's easier to get in and
out if you got a door.

417
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:25,312
It's hard climbing through
the window sometimes.

418
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:28,248
Here we go.

419
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,368
Take a little dark color,

420
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:33,236
put the indication of a few
boards and stuff on there

421
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:34,817
if you want them.

422
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:38,292
And you could have made
a log cabin just as easy.

423
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,552
Let's take a little red,a little white,

424
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,487
a little dark sienna in it.

425
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,216
Let's see, maybe,

426
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:47,968
yeah, why not?

427
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:51,904
Maybe this has got
little red roof on there.

428
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:54,142
It's not in too good a shape either.

429
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,420
Not in too good a shape, the
whole shingle's about fell off,

430
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,714
it's got some holes in it.

431
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,300
Yeah, a few little highlights,
right up here on top

432
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,019
where the sun's really
zinging across the top.

433
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,343
A few little dooders down the side here,

434
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:14,259
so it stands out.

435
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,629
There.

436
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:19,165
Got us a little cabin.

437
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,353
All right, now we can go back to our

438
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:25,521
brush with a grass color on it,

439
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,491
and we can begin putting
in all kinds of little

440
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:30,994
grassy areas like this,

441
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:33,153
right up here by the trees.

442
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:35,531
These trees remind me
of my little squirrel.

443
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,199
What'd be a good place for him to live?

444
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,103
I want to show you my little
squirrel one more time.

445
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:40,770
Shoot, I've showed him
to you a couple of times

446
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,105
in this series.

447
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:44,673
He's one of the cutest little
devils that you've ever seen.

448
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,942
He's Pea Pod Junior.

449
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:49,256
He likes to live in my pocket.

450
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,580
Of course, by the time
you get to see this,

451
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,660
he'll already be turned
lose, and he'll be free,

452
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,253
probably living in my backyard, and

453
00:18:57,253 --> 00:19:00,173
he'll have a little condo
back there in a tree.

454
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,041
I love these little old rascals.

455
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,878
I raise a bunch of them
every year, turn them lose,

456
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,213
and they go back to nature,
where they're supposed to be.

457
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:15,756
Hope you enjoy seeing
those little rascals,

458
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:17,675
they're really special to me, and

459
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:20,260
I like to share them with my friends.

460
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,965
All right, maybe over in here,

461
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,284
okay, I see a thing happening here,

462
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:29,720
it's a place for a path, right there.

463
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,206
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it.

464
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,391
As you, (laughs), I'm
sorry to get excited,

465
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:38,076
as you paint, you begin
seeing things here.

466
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,298
They just sort of happen.

467
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:41,265
Watch here, watch here.

468
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:44,551
We take a little brown, a
little brown, and maybe,

469
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:47,369
you see the indication of a
little path coming out here,

470
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:50,911
maybe sort of disappears, comes out here,

471
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:53,661
around.

472
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,596
It just, these things happen.

473
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,932
Don't fight them when they happen.

474
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,317
Very quickly, you'll learn
to use anything that happens

475
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:03,319
in your painting, and it might make

476
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,938
some of the most interesting compositions.

477
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,534
A little bit of brown and white,

478
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:13,788
just a small amount, and
we can highlight a little,

479
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:15,815
just so it stands out here and there.

480
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,350
All right.

481
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,037
Tell you what we need here.

482
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:20,853
Let me find a liner brush.

483
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:24,024
Take a little paint thinner,

484
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,511
and we need a few little
sticks and twigs that live

485
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,630
right along in here.

486
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:34,468
Maybe, maybe even

487
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:37,922
something on out in here,

488
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:39,863
old stick that lives there.

489
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:42,308
Might've been a little tree there that

490
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:45,512
didn't have such a good time,
things got rough on him.

491
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,764
Okay, let's get crazy.

492
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,168
We've got a minute left here.

493
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,801
Take a little bit of the midnight black,

494
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,886
vandyke brown mixed together.

495
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:57,406
All right, bravery test.

496
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:58,724
Here it comes.

497
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,228
(whistling noise)

498
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,330
Got to make those little weird noises.

499
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,189
We got a happy little tree
that lives right there,

500
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:09,394
and he's got a friend, too.

501
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,270
See?

502
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:14,141
Now we got two little
trees that live there.

503
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,644
Now let's go back to our liner brush.

504
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,929
Need the paint thinner
though, to make the paint

505
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,600
very thin, so it'll literally flow

506
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,618
right over the top of the paint
that's already on the cavas.

507
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:27,504
Turn the bristles in there.

508
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:28,805
That brings it to a very sharp point.

509
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,539
There, you can see it?

510
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,125
See, just turn them, like that.

511
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:35,895
Now,

512
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,215
Now, if it's thin enough, it'll just flow

513
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,750
right over the top of that paint,

514
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,701
without mixing together.

515
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,988
About like that,

516
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:48,008
and you can put in all kinds
of little arms on your trees.

517
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,144
Just wherever you want them.

518
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:53,797
You have to decide though, like,

519
00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:54,664
which one's in front?

520
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,516
Which one's behind?

521
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:59,653
These are decisions that
you make in your own world.

522
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:02,788
Gives you a lot of power, doesn't it?

523
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:05,590
There we are.

524
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:08,946
Okay.

525
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:09,978
You know, every day we get letters from

526
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:12,383
fantastic friends all over the country

527
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:15,183
who are picking up their
brush and trying this,

528
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:16,818
and they're saying, "You
told me I could do it,

529
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:20,071
and I never believed it until I tried.

530
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,692
Now I have my whole family painting."

531
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:23,993
That's so wonderful, when families

532
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:26,262
do things together,
because this is something

533
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,331
you can do with your spouse,

534
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:31,668
with your children,
with friends, neighbors,

535
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:34,738
or even people you want to be your friend.

536
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:36,722
It's a good way to meet new people,

537
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,009
because people who paint just seem to be

538
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:42,195
some of the nicest people.

539
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:44,548
There we are.

540
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:46,399
All kinds of little dooders.

541
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:50,820
And you decide, once again.

542
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,249
You must make these decisions.

543
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:55,191
We don't want to tell you how many limbs

544
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:56,492
to put on your tree, or even

545
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:58,794
what kind of tree to paint,

546
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,346
because painting is a
very individual thing.

547
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,586
There.

548
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:07,403
I'm going to take a little white,

549
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:09,105
a little bit of the midnight black,

550
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:11,340
paint thinner,

551
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,976
just mix them together a little bit,

552
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:14,084
black and white,

553
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:16,211
or white and black,

554
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,147
and I'm going to come right along here,

555
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,165
put a little highlight right
on the side of that tree.

556
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:21,852
There.

557
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:23,436
If the sun's up here, zing.

558
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:28,673
Just to make him a little
sparkler on the side there.

559
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:32,312
Something about like that.

560
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:35,565
All right, go back to our brush that's

561
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:38,118
got the sap green and
all the yellows on it.

562
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:40,519
Tap a little color.

563
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:44,890
And let's just clean up the
bottom of its foot here,

564
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:47,527
bring all that together.

565
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:53,750
Maybe, maybe there's a little

566
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,118
baby tree down here.

567
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:56,903
He's going to take over one day.

568
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,387
One day, he'll be the big tree,

569
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,774
but now he's just a little baby,

570
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:03,559
and I think with that,

571
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,428
shoot, we've about got
a finished painting.

572
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,067
Take a little paint thinner, a
little bit of the bright red,

573
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,758
and let's sign this little rascal.

574
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:14,770
Really hope you've enjoyed
this little painting.

575
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,156
It's a very simple little painting.

576
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,242
It'll work for you.

577
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:22,377
If you have time, take a
photograph and send to us.

578
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,579
All of us here at the
station would love to see

579
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,432
what you're doing.

580
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,051
So, until then, from all of us here,

581
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,886
I'd like to wish you happy painting,

582
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,771
and God bless, my friend.

583
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:37,609
