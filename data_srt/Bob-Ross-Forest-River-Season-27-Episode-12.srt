1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,355
- Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:04,857
Certainly glad you could join us today,

3
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:07,860
because today we're going to
have just a fantastic time.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,294
Let's start out and have
'em run all the colors

5
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:12,097
across the screen, that you
need to paint along with us.

6
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:13,265
While they're doing that,

7
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:15,501
let me show you what's happening up here.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,800
I thought today I'd show ya

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,903
how to use a black, white and grey gesso

10
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:22,173
to make a fantastic effect.

11
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,474
Now I've taken these
three colors of gesso,

12
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,844
and using an old liner brush,

13
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:27,278
one that I didn't care anything about,

14
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,147
I've just made some little tree shapes.

15
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,416
That's all there is to it.

16
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,951
You just pull it down with a liner brush,

17
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,985
make a little limb here and there,

18
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:38,589
and then take the liner brush sidewards,

19
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,759
and put in these little fluffy areas.

20
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,393
It sorta looks like leaves.

21
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:43,995
But that's really all there is to it.

22
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:47,465
After it's totally dry, completely dry,

23
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,567
I've covered the entire canvas with

24
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:52,302
a very thin coat of Liquid Clear.

25
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,939
Now clear is transparent,

26
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,509
and you have a tendency
to put too much of it on.

27
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,911
If you have any doubt in your mind,

28
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,711
and you think you may have too much,

29
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:03,714
take a paper towel and
wipe your canvas down.

30
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:06,117
What's left will be just right.

31
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,518
Tell you what, let's do it.

32
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:09,921
This is a fun painting
that anybody can do.

33
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,089
This is a good one.

34
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:12,823
If it's your first or second painting,

35
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,359
this is wonderful.

36
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,993
If you've painted before,

37
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,864
this is one that'll, it
will certainly excite you.

38
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:20,599
I'll start with a little Phthalo Blue.

39
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,936
It's a beautiful,
beautiful blue, I love it.

40
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:27,005
Think it's one of the
nicest colors that we have.

41
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,606
Just put a little in the two inch brush,

42
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:30,007
and let's go up in here.

43
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,143
There's not a lot of paint on the brush.

44
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,909
And I'm just gonna start

45
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:36,648
and just make my little
criss-cross strokes, as usual,

46
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:38,582
and paint right over this.

47
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:41,935
And fantastic things will happen.

48
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,186
Look at that.

49
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:46,457
Already, it looks like, it looks like

50
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:49,950
the sky is showing
right through the trees.

51
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,764
This is one of the neatest effects.

52
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:53,998
And it's not limited to this,

53
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:56,817
you can do anything with this gesso.

54
00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:59,237
There.

55
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,571
And where the canvas is dark,

56
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:04,393
I've used lighter gesso, and vice versa.

57
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,679
Look at there,

58
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:10,914
see already we have a basic background in,

59
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:12,281
and done.

60
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:14,753
Let's see, while I got
that blue on my brush,

61
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:16,453
I'm gonna add a little
more of the Prussian Blue,

62
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:18,757
cause it's stronger, it'll
go right over the top.

63
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:22,225
In the corners, I'm gonna darken a little,

64
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,361
with Prussian Blue.

65
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,298
Prussian Blue is much stronger.

66
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,366
Much deeper.

67
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,602
See there, there we go.

68
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:32,802
Just the corners though.

69
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:35,406
And that, in turn, will
make this look brighter.

70
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:38,308
If you make this darker,
this gets lighter.

71
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,610
Now,

72
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,212
we've got Prussian Blue on the brush.

73
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:45,316
I'll just sort of rub a little of that

74
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,387
right here on the canvas.

75
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,555
I know you can't see anything,

76
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:52,323
but when we put a little color on there,

77
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:54,759
beautiful things will happen.

78
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,294
There.

79
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:58,896
Alright, ready to wash the old brush?

80
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:00,697
That's the fun part.

81
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,634
That's the fun part.

82
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,268
Let's wash it.

83
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:07,771
As you know, we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner

84
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,474
Just scrub 'em off, give it a good shake.

85
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:12,977
(brush thuds)

86
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:15,747
(laughs) And cover the entire studio.

87
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:18,217
That's really the fun part of it.

88
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,850
Now sometimes,

89
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,252
when you're walking in the woods,

90
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,754
which I do quite frequently,

91
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:25,021
and you look out and you see
the light coming through,

92
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:28,658
it's so bright, it just, it
burns right through the trees.

93
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,528
Watch, watch, it's easier to show you.

94
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:31,662
Take the brush,

95
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:34,032
I'm just gonna take one corner.

96
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:35,400
Just one corner.

97
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,669
That's a beautiful close-up there.

98
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:37,770
One corner,

99
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,469
and get a little Titanium White on it.

100
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,737
Now come up here.

101
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,306
Decide where the sun's at back there,

102
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,673
shining through all these trees.

103
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:47,578
And very lightly just begin,

104
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:50,382
that light area, and begin working around.

105
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:52,750
Notice that we're keeping that corner

106
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,485
in the light spot.

107
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:58,055
And we work around and
around and around we go,

108
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:00,025
there we are, see there?

109
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,592
And begin blending outward.

110
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:04,630
Now this paint is very opaque.

111
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,631
We've used transparent color up until now,

112
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,868
and now we're getting into opaque color.

113
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,736
But that sun's burning through there.

114
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:15,454
Light's just zinging right through.

115
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,942
But by blending it out,

116
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,177
it'll become transparent enough

117
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,180
that you can still see the
tree shapes through there.

118
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,048
That's what we're trying to achieve.

119
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,798
To me, that's what it
looks like when I see

120
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:30,221
the sun shining through.

121
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,972
There.

122
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,658
You can still make out the
images of the trees in there,

123
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,259
but they're washed out.

124
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:37,695
The same as if you're looking at 'em

125
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:41,266
in the woods, and the
sun shinings through.

126
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,401
Just like that, and we
can blend a little light

127
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:45,067
right on down through here.

128
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,836
Up to you, up to you,

129
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:49,173
you decide where it lives.

130
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,308
You decide.

131
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:51,975
There.

132
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,345
Now you could do this several times

133
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:55,612
to achieve a desired lightness,

134
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:56,646
or a desired brightness.

135
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,649
This is about all that I want.

136
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:02,603
I just want that nice spot
shining through there strong.

137
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:05,556
I like that when that happens.

138
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,891
Okay.
(brush thuds)

139
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,528
Actually, I just wanted
to clean the brush again.

140
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,529
Already, we're in business.

141
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,631
Now we have to make some big decision.

142
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,968
What's happening here in our world?

143
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:19,137
Let's take some black,

144
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:21,437
and some Prussian Blue.

145
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,074
I'll be right back, I'm
gonna get a little crimson

146
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:25,142
and put in there too.

147
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:28,078
Tell you what, maybe even a
little Sap Green, a little brown

148
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,781
a little Van Dyke,

149
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:32,550
just all the dark colors,
it doesn't matter.

150
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,451
Okay, let's go up here.

151
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,920
Now in my mind,

152
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,457
I see back in here,

153
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:40,925
maybe a little grassy area that lives

154
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,026
right underneath these trees,

155
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,528
so I'll just tap them a little dark.

156
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:45,862
Don't need much because the black gesso

157
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,665
has created most of it.

158
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,867
We don't have to worry about it.

159
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:52,920
About like that, that's
all we're looking for.

160
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:55,105
There.

161
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,942
Just let it disappear back in there.

162
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,278
Hmm, okay.

163
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:03,746
Same brush, I'm gonna go
right into some Cad Yellow,

164
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,348
some Yellow Ochre.

165
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,851
Let's just load some
color on the brush here.

166
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:11,322
Tap it, push it, give
it a little (grunts).

167
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:12,855
See that little ridge
of paint right there?

168
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:14,692
It's what we're looking for.

169
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:16,427
Let's go back up here.

170
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:19,097
Now we can come back with
this beautiful green color,

171
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,966
and just begin tapping in the indication

172
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,370
of some little grassy
areas that live far away.

173
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,271
Far away, very soft.

174
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,939
Very soft.

175
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,492
There, sneak 'em around
some of those trees.

176
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:35,579
There.

177
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,483
Reload the brush as you need it.

178
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,951
Alright, but very gently.

179
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:42,586
All you do is barely touching the canvas.

180
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:45,956
Color shows up, it seems
like 100 times better,

181
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:48,860
stronger on a black canvas than it does

182
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,095
on a white canvas.

183
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:53,614
It's amazing what happens to color.

184
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,518
There.

185
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,668
See, wherever you want 'em to be.

186
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,520
Wherever.

187
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:03,038
Maybe, maybe a little,

188
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,793
a little projection
sticks out right there.

189
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:10,615
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

190
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:12,516
We can make a little bump,

191
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,550
just by doing that,

192
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,319
whatever you want, you decide.

193
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,237
Alright.

194
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,656
Now, I'm gonna grab
another two inch brush,

195
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,459
I have several of 'em.
(brush thuds)

196
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:23,894
Make sure it's good and dry.

197
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:26,797
Small amount of Titanium White on it.

198
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,533
Now we put color on here.

199
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,134
Even though it doesn't look like it,

200
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:34,673
there's a little bit of
that blue that we put on.

201
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:38,175
Very gently pull down.

202
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,278
Don't put a lot of color on here.

203
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:42,814
It shows up, once again, so bright.

204
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:46,485
You need very, very
little white to do this.

205
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:48,252
Very little.

206
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:51,302
And it's important that
you pull it straight down.

207
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:54,291
Straight down, okay.

208
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,294
Then we go across.

209
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:58,229
Just enough to make it look like

210
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,031
a little watery area under here.

211
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:03,067
Now you could just as easy have painted

212
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,468
those trees with the gesso in the water,

213
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:06,704
and reflected 'em.

214
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:09,372
I think in the last
series, or series before,

215
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:10,841
I sorta lose track of them,

216
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:13,510
I think we done that, and it's gorgeous.

217
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:15,045
You can do it.

218
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,980
You can do it.

219
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,483
Now, shoot, that worked pretty good.

220
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,552
I'm gonna go back and get some dark.

221
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:25,838
That was black, blue and
oh, crimson, whatever.

222
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,758
I want another one over here.

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,693
I like that one so well.

224
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,361
Look at here, we'll just
put us another little

225
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:35,632
little projection that comes
right out through here.

226
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,352
Little dark color in there.

227
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,153
There.

228
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:45,703
Okay, back into our yellows,
Indian, Yellow Ochre.

229
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:48,178
Cadmium Yellow.

230
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,380
Also I hit a Bright
Red, believe it or not,

231
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,749
red will dull the color,

232
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:55,019
cause red and green make brown.

233
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:55,754
So every once in a while,

234
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,519
I hit a little bit of the Bright Red,

235
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,908
sometimes more to dull
than to make things bright.

236
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:03,659
There.

237
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,429
Just begin forming this.

238
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,798
Just begin working with it.

239
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,134
Think about the lay of the land.

240
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,503
Just drop those little devils in there.

241
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:14,054
They're everywhere.

242
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,306
There.

243
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,108
But isn't that gesso,

244
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:19,342
it's one of the most fantastic ideas

245
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,062
we've ever come up with.

246
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:26,017
Colored gessos are really wonderful.

247
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:27,433
There.

248
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,854
Don't know why we didn't
do this a long time ago,

249
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:34,091
it makes like so much
easier when you're painting.

250
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,626
And you can put things in like,

251
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,594
like if you wanted to paint
a little house or a building,

252
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:39,931
you could do it all with the gesso,

253
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:41,831
and then basically, all you need to do is

254
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,601
just take, put some clear over it,

255
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,302
come back with a little color.

256
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,773
And it's there, that quick.
(snaps fingers)

257
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,175
Take a little bit of the,

258
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,641
little bit of the Titanium White,

259
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:55,427
and I'm gonna put a little
touch of reflection under here.

260
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,283
Just a touch, just a touch.

261
00:09:58,283 --> 00:09:59,618
Don't want a lot.

262
00:09:59,618 --> 00:10:01,152
Want to keep this pretty dark,

263
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:05,406
so that light area back
here really shines.

264
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:08,843
There we go.

265
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:11,528
About like that, then once again,

266
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,432
just go across, just go across,

267
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:16,450
that's all there is to it.

268
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,535
Isn't that easy?

269
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,172
I knew you'd like this one.

270
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:23,109
I think it's one of my favorite paintings

271
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:25,075
in the whole series.

272
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:28,345
It's so easy, it's great for people who

273
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:29,745
are just beginning to paint,

274
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,783
and just beginning to
experience The Joy of Painting.

275
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:34,619
Hey, there's a commercial!

276
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:37,172
Alright, let's put some stones in there.

277
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,990
We'll put some little stones.

278
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,558
I'm gonna take some,

279
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,794
I'm gonna take some black
and a little Van Dyke Brown,

280
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:47,096
put it in there, just mix it up real good.

281
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,033
Little Dark Sienna too, what the heck,

282
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,634
little more of the Sienna.

283
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,002
Okay, Now I'm gonna go over here,

284
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,054
and get some paint thinner.

285
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:58,207
I'm gonna thin this paint
down, til it's very thin.

286
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:59,409
Remember our golden rule,

287
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,978
a thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

288
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,014
We'll thin that down.

289
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,383
There, that's good.

290
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:10,054
That's good, let me clean the knife.

291
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,687
We'll take some white,

292
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:14,192
oh, we'll use a little Dark Sienna,

293
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,342
a little Van Dyke Brown,

294
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,480
I'm gonna make a highlight
color for the rocks.

295
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,033
Oh, I like that, that's good.

296
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,668
It's not too bright.

297
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:26,203
Okay, do the same thing again.

298
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:28,972
I'm gonna thin this
paint with paint thinner,

299
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:31,976
til it's pretty thin, pretty thin.

300
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:35,596
It's about the consistency
of soft face cream.

301
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:39,750
Or butter that you've left out.

302
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,552
You know, sometime you
leave the butter out,

303
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:43,187
it gets real soft and gooey,

304
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:45,389
that's what we're looking for.

305
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,908
Okay, let me clean off my knife.

306
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:50,827
Now probably the easiest
way I've ever found

307
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:53,363
of making very effective little stones,

308
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,367
is using a little Filbert brush.

309
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,602
Okay, and let's go through
the dark color first.

310
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:02,206
Both sides, okay, stay right there

311
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:03,673
and I'll bring the light up.

312
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,808
We have both sides full of dark.

313
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,379
I'm gonna take only one
side, and go through light.

314
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:11,148
So we have light, dark, light, dark.

315
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,317
Now we can go back in here,

316
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,985
and you have to make big decisions.

317
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,254
Where does all these
little rocks and stones

318
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:17,922
live in your world?

319
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:19,356
You can put a million of 'em in.

320
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:22,975
Or one or two, it's up to you.

321
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:24,695
I like little stones.

322
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:28,165
This is the easiest way,
there he is, that I know of

323
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,168
to put them in there.

324
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,269
Maybe over here, they're
getting a little bigger.

325
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:33,803
Big old rock.

326
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,004
But in one stroke, you can put

327
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,606
the top and the bottom of the rock in,

328
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:37,908
that easy.

329
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:39,176
Let's put some on the other side.

330
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,828
We don't want him left out.

331
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:43,396
There.

332
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:45,782
Look at all those little rocks.

333
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:47,618
I used to agonize over rocks,

334
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:48,819
trying to get them in there,

335
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,122
worked myself to death.

336
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:53,724
And, you see how easy it is.

337
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,826
If you want great big rocks,

338
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:58,428
then use our little oval brush.

339
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,430
The one that just jumps right in there.

340
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,998
I'm gonna take a little liner brush,

341
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:05,269
a little bit of white,
a little blue in it,

342
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:07,238
a little Phthalo Blue in it.

343
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:09,406
Mostly white.

344
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,407
Instead of using the knife today,

345
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:13,878
I'm just gonna take the liner brush,

346
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,079
and just here and there,

347
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:18,248
sort of work a little water
line right around the stones,

348
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:20,618
like that, look at there,

349
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:23,052
just let it wander around.

350
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,807
Wherever you want it.

351
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,640
Wherever you want it.

352
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,795
It just cleans up the edge,

353
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:32,879
and the bottom of these little rocks.

354
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:34,848
There.

355
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,234
See there, then they can
come on out through here,

356
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,769
they can be a few little things.

357
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,304
You could do this with a
knife if you wanted to.

358
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:43,139
I thought today, we'll just do
it with a little liner brush.

359
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,576
But you need a thin paint.

360
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,596
So it'll just zip right over there.

361
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:50,899
There we go.

362
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,484
Something like that, when you do yours,

363
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:56,920
take your time and really,
really do 'em nice.

364
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,555
We're a little pressed for time here,

365
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:01,024
so I have to do it a little quicker.

366
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:05,278
But when you do it,
just enjoy it, enjoy it.

367
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,614
Alright.

368
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,851
We gotta put something
in our foreground here.

369
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,304
We'll just go back to our brush that's

370
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,238
got all that dark on it.

371
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:18,057
We had blue and black and some brown.

372
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:22,345
See, Sap Green, Alizarin Crimson,

373
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,915
bravery test, (blows air).

374
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:29,569
Maybe in our world it comes
right across like that.

375
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:33,557
There, just tap that in.

376
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:35,908
Just tap it in.

377
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:38,645
Fill it up.

378
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:42,066
Fill it up, a lot of

379
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,517
good dark color in there.

380
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,555
There.

381
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:50,057
Now then.

382
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,978
Okay.

383
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,011
Let's go into our yellow,

384
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,282
same thing as we did before.

385
00:14:57,283 --> 00:14:58,916
I'm just gonna do the same basic thing.

386
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,984
Get some green here.

387
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,451
By taking that color we had on the brush

388
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:06,505
and going into yellow,
automatically, we get green.

389
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,393
And then we can begin
just putting all kinds

390
00:15:09,393 --> 00:15:12,497
of little grassy areas back in here.

391
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,599
There they come, there they come.

392
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,968
If you just take your time,
and you keep tapping this,

393
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,972
it'll get so smooth, you
almost can't believe it.

394
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:24,642
There.

395
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:27,544
Just little soft grassy areas.

396
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:30,063
There they go, right on out.

397
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:34,801
There, a little more paint on the brush.

398
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:37,721
Alright.

399
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:40,875
Just keep working it
back and forth though.

400
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:43,843
Something like that.

401
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:46,880
Okay.

402
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,933
Just sort of let your imagination go.

403
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,635
Painting is so great,

404
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:55,206
because your imagination
on that piece of canvas

405
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,456
can become reality.

406
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,643
Can become reality, and sometimes,

407
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:02,213
we all need to escape from reality.

408
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,813
This is the place to do it.

409
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:07,416
Here, everything's peaceful and quiet.

410
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:13,274
There's no bad things here,
these are happy places here.

411
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:15,758
Now, watch here, watch here, watch.

412
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,260
Sometimes, come right up in here.

413
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,497
Sometimes it's fun to take this brush,

414
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:23,900
put it up here, and give it
a little upward push, watch.

415
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,370
Bloop, see that little grassy area?

416
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,339
Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

417
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:29,406
That's all there is to it.

418
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,042
Gotta make those noises
though, or it doesn't work.

419
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:34,812
There, just like that.

420
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,748
Maybe the grass over
here is a little taller.

421
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:38,652
You work in layers.

422
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:39,617
There.

423
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:42,568
And we can go back to just tapping.

424
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:45,871
Like that.

425
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:48,421
There.

426
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:49,960
And then maybe, bloop, yep you're right,

427
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,562
there's another, bloop, bloop.

428
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,132
A little glassy area right there.

429
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,432
Wherever you want 'em.

430
00:16:57,952 --> 00:17:00,670
And over here, it's much softer.

431
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,373
Much, much softer.

432
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:03,807
Over here's where you'd wanna,

433
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:04,842
you wanna take your shoes off,

434
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:07,411
and run through there with naked foots.

435
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,879
That'd be fun, I like the feel of grass

436
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:12,881
on the bottom of my feet with no shoes on.

437
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,902
I think that's a neat feeling.

438
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:16,888
There.

439
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,422
When we were kids, my brother Jim and I,

440
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:22,459
we used to run all through
the woods in Florida.

441
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,714
Shoot, we were tough, we didn't
even wear shoes back then.

442
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:30,634
Probably because we didn't have any.

443
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,102
Bloop.

444
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:35,923
More little grassy areas, there.

445
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,575
Just as many as you want.

446
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,326
You know what we need?

447
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,529
You know, don't ya?

448
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,949
We need a tree.

449
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,586
Let's take some Van Dyke,
a little Dark Sienna,

450
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:51,422
mix them together with an old fan brush.

451
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:54,574
And let's have a bravery test, right now.

452
00:17:55,392 --> 00:17:57,527
(laughs) Here we go.

453
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:59,398
I want a tree that lives right there.

454
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:01,396
Oh, right through the pretty rocks.

455
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:04,067
It's okay, we know they're back there.

456
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,605
Just pull it through, (blows air).

457
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,706
Like that.

458
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,192
Big strong tree.

459
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:14,678
See, it just keeps growing.

460
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,080
Can always make them bigger.

461
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,246
Sometimes, it's a son of a gun to try

462
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,082
to make them smaller,

463
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,884
but you can always make them bigger.

464
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:23,386
Put a big old foot on him out here,

465
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:25,989
so he has something to stand on.

466
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:27,625
There.

467
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,294
Tell you what, let's just
use a little Filbert.

468
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:32,829
We'll take a little white, a little brown.

469
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:37,166
And just, just let that
work right down the edge.

470
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,368
That's too bright, I don't
like that, too bright.

471
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,504
Let me darken it up a little.

472
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:44,208
Too bright, oh that's much better.

473
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,675
That's much better.

474
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:47,944
See, if you don't like
something, change it.

475
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:50,614
In your world, you have
that kind of power.

476
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:52,817
You can do anything.

477
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:55,553
Anything.

478
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:57,188
There, see it gives the impression

479
00:18:57,188 --> 00:19:00,774
of an old rough mean tree
lives out here. (growls)

480
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:05,744
There he is, we need
some arms on our tree.

481
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,448
Let me wipe that color off.

482
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,084
Liner brush, there he is.

483
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:15,971
Little paint thinner,
little Van Dyke Brown.

484
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,543
There we go.

485
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:22,294
And in our world, there's
an arm lives on this tree.

486
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,799
Right there, there he is.

487
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,485
Put a few arms, let's put
some leaves on this tree,

488
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:30,554
so we don't have to put many arms.

489
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:33,858
Maybe there's one that
hangs off here that, mmm,

490
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:35,358
there.

491
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:36,860
Now let's put a few leaves on there.

492
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:38,996
We get a fan brush,

493
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:42,666
take some dark color, black, blue.

494
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:46,952
Maybe a little Sap Green,
and crimson in it too.

495
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:51,009
And our world, there it is.

496
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,509
Push in a little dark first.

497
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:57,248
There, don't wanna
cover up all that trunk,

498
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:58,932
but some of it.

499
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,852
There we go.

500
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,621
Gives us an idea of where
some nice limbs are.

501
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:05,990
I'm gonna go right into
the yellow with that color,

502
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,393
since it had blue in it,
we'll have instant green.

503
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:11,861
There, and push upward again.

504
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:12,964
Sometime we push down,

505
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,697
sometime upward.

506
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:17,034
Let me get a little more color on here.

507
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:18,802
It's up to you.

508
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,137
Up to you, there it comes.

509
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,957
See, don't want to get
too much of this in here.

510
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:28,012
Just enough to make
this old tree stand out

511
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:30,346
and sing in the sunshine.

512
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:31,715
Right there.

513
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:33,065
There it is.

514
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:35,986
There.

515
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,653
Okay.

516
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,256
Now we can take our old

517
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:42,359
number two inch brush right
here, and put a little grass

518
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,293
around his foots.

519
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:48,098
I'm still feeling crazy,
and I got a minute left.

520
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,700
I like to do this because it,

521
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,303
it upsets my director when
we're getting low on time,

522
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:54,071
and I do something like (whistles).

523
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,907
Maybe there's an old
tree, fell down. (laughs)

524
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:00,276
This old tree just fell
down, it was tired.

525
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:05,715
He's a tired old tree,
and I can relate to that.

526
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:08,284
Put a little highlight
along his edge here.

527
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:10,670
Just use a little brown and white.

528
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:13,459
That was just Van Dyke
Brown we made him with,

529
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,991
just like the one standing up.

530
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:18,078
This one, this one he's
laying down on the job.

531
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:21,231
Laying down on the job.

532
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:24,367
That's okay, he had a long life.

533
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,570
Now he wants to rest.

534
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,106
We'll put a few old limbs
that are still on here.

535
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:32,210
Some coming out from
the side, and going out.

536
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,910
There, if you had trouble
making this slide,

537
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,680
all you gotta do is just add a little more

538
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,749
paint thinner to it.

539
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:41,652
There, see whole limbs are just,

540
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:44,386
just handing around out here.

541
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,438
There we are.

542
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,459
Go into a little bit of

543
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:52,362
white, brown, like a lighter color.

544
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:55,899
And we can highlight those a
little, just so they stand out.

545
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,017
Something like that.

546
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,303
There.

547
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:04,524
There, old tree's just
laying out there asleep.

548
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,425
Now then.

549
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:08,645
Let's go back and get our brush

550
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:10,730
that's got the dark color on it.

551
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:14,116
I want a little, I want a
little bush living right here,

552
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:15,551
so I'll put one in.

553
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:19,254
In your world, you put them
in anywhere you want 'em.

554
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,191
Put some dark in.

555
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,326
Go into a little bit of light,

556
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:24,929
I'm gonna use a little
into the Yellow Ochre side,

557
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:26,813
a little touch.

558
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:30,432
Nah, want more Yellow Ochre than that.

559
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,470
If you're not happy with it, change it.

560
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,988
Oh, that's better, now I'm happier.

561
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:37,590
There we go.

562
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:41,493
There we go, all kinds of little things.

563
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,630
Like that.

564
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:48,586
See, you can put these in
anywhere that you want 'em.

565
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:50,453
Just any old place.

566
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,556
Just to make it look
like theres a little bush

567
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:53,524
right here on the edge.

568
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:55,574
It goes right off the canvas.

569
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:58,477
Happy little bush.

570
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:00,681
Okay.

571
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:04,034
Back to our little liner brush.

572
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:06,170
Little light brown color on it.

573
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,771
And here and there and there,

574
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,839
we can put in a stick or a twig.

575
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:13,026
Whatever you think,

576
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,127
just a couple.

577
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:19,816
And, we had rocks on the other side,

578
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,451
let me go back to my Filbert

579
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:23,187
that had the rock color on it.

580
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:25,354
Any maybe over here, there's a rock or two

581
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:27,857
that lives on this side.

582
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:28,924
I know that side's better,

583
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,995
but all the rocks didn't move over there.

584
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:32,980
There's still a couple here.

585
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:35,731
Still a couple, where do they live?

586
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:38,531
Here's one right up against a tree.

587
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:41,821
Yeah, wherever you want 'em, you decide.

588
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:43,939
There.

589
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:46,042
Maybe right down here at
the base of that big tree,

590
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,894
lives a little stone.

591
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:51,715
You make the decision, but
he may live right there,

592
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:53,282
that's okay.

593
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:54,384
Shoot, I think we're about ready

594
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:56,870
for a signature on this one.

595
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:00,489
Take a little paint thinner, a
little bit of the Bright Red,

596
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,276
and we'll sign it.

597
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:04,661
I have people write and they say

598
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:06,263
"Do you have to sign with red?"

599
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:09,865
Absolutely not, you sign
with any color that you want.

600
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,568
I just sorta got in the
habit of signing with red,

601
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,504
and I always do it.

602
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:16,607
It's sorta became a trademark,

603
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:19,491
but you sign in any color that you want.

604
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,411
There we are.

605
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:23,380
I think we're gonna
call that one finished.

606
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,714
Hope you've enjoyed it.

607
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,615
I'd like to hear from you,

608
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:27,650
if you try this black
and white and grey gesso,

609
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,652
because it does fantastic things.

610
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:31,386
From all of us here, I'd like to wish you

611
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,857
happy painting, and God bless, my friend.

612
