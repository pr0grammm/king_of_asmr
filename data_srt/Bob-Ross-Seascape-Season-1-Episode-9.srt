1
00:00:01,393 --> 00:00:02,839
- Well, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,203
Thought today we'd do a little picture

3
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:08,208
that maybe has got a
little calm ocean, and...

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,020
And we'll play with clouds today,

5
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:12,537
we'll play with light reflecting
all though the clouds,

6
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:15,737
and see what kind thing
we can come up with here.

7
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:17,381
And we're gonna start out,

8
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:20,132
I'm gonna take a little bit of yellow,

9
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:23,382
and just a little bit of Permanent Red,

10
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:25,908
and we're gonna work with the sun today.

11
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:28,684
We're gonna put the sun in here.

12
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:30,388
Now I've already covered the canvas

13
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:34,555
with a thin layer of Magic
White, save a little time.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,881
Next we'll go into a little bit of white,

15
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:41,673
and a touch of Alizarin Crimson.

16
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:44,575
And we'll work that a little bit.

17
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,408
And maybe very gently.

18
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,914
And always making these little X patterns.

19
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:59,408
There we go, just work it
right on back into here.

20
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:01,943
And then I'm gonna go
into a little Alizarin,

21
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:04,201
a little touch of Prussian Blue.

22
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:08,150
It makes sort of a, oh like
a little lavender color here.

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,158
And we'll just work that
from out here inward.

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,326
We'll play with some crazy
colors in the sky today.

25
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,817
Just come right on
around with it like that.

26
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,534
There we go.

27
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,823
I know somebody's out
there sayin' already,

28
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,905
"sure don't look like the sun to me."

29
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:53,694
Now let's take the big brush,

30
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:56,424
and we're gonna start
bringing all this together,

31
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:57,424
very gently.

32
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:06,493
There we go.

33
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:10,242
See how all those colors
just blend together?

34
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:23,877
Now we'll hypnotize it, just a little bit.

35
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,413
And while I've got this brush dirty,

36
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:29,017
I'll take just a little touch of the blue.

37
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,766
And lavender mixed together here.

38
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:35,277
And we'll do this.

39
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,112
And bring it right in here.

40
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:44,504
We don't wanna destroy this
nice, reflected light area

41
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:48,004
that we're putting into the water already.

42
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:52,318
Just very gently bring all this together.

43
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:55,489
There we go.

44
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,425
Clean up the brush.

45
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,018
Now, let's take a little Titanium White.

46
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:20,322
Load the brush full,

47
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:22,965
and we'll go right into
the center of this.

48
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:24,610
We'll grind that into the canvas,

49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,829
just really push that color in.

50
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,662
There.

51
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,020
And we'll take the knife,

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,388
and take off the excess paint.

53
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:41,056
The value remains in the canvas.

54
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:45,664
And now we can work
with that a little bit.

55
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:48,819
And the first color we put on,

56
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:53,171
turns out to be the aura
that's around the sun.

57
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,004
Okay, now.

58
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,208
We can play with some
almighty clouds here,

59
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,292
and we'll take a little
brown, and a little blue.

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,299
Make up a nice little color here.

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,050
Sort of a grey color.

62
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:16,307
And let's build some almighty clouds.

63
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:22,413
And we just let these
run right across the sun.

64
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:25,664
Be careful not to put
too much blue into this,

65
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,498
you want it to grey,

66
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:29,416
otherwise when you hit that yellow,

67
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,833
it's gonna turn green on you.

68
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,088
There we go.

69
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,735
Nice fluffy little cloud.

70
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:47,149
Just layin' around here
in the sky, bein' lazy.

71
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,855
Okay maybe we'll have
another little cloud up here.

72
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,536
Just let him play.

73
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:02,514
There he goes.

74
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:20,125
Now let's put some
highlights on these clouds.

75
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,505
And right close to the sun here

76
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:24,088
I want them to be quite bright.

77
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:25,776
There.

78
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:34,175
Little bit more into the
orangey type, pinkish hue.

79
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,425
There we go, that's better.

80
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:01,300
And a little brighter
on this edge right here.

81
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,274
And there we are.

82
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:13,937
Just lay these on.

83
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,533
Let all these pretty little colors

84
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,699
just sort of float through the clouds.

85
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:33,029
And mix the color in your brush.

86
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:37,195
That way you have a multitude
of colors all in one brush.

87
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:43,313
Now on this cloud, the
light, as you can see,

88
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:44,778
is coming from the other direction.

89
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:48,945
So it's gonna hit the bottom
of the cloud more than the top.

90
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:55,514
And we'll put some little
sparkles here and there.

91
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:03,908
There we go.

92
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:09,251
Maybe some little highlights
just playing around.

93
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:14,086
Now we'll take the big
brush, and very gently,

94
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:18,253
super, super light, just
enough to bring this together.

95
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,373
Just wanna blend them together.

96
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,750
Little little bit.

97
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,333
Build some of the
highlights here and there.

98
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:48,228
Now we can hypnotize the whole thing.

99
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:52,412
If you haven't used a firm
paint, now you're in trouble.

100
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:55,828
So be sure your paint is very, very firm.

101
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:04,885
Now let's put some little small clouds,

102
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,802
just lay it along here.

103
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:14,471
Just little stringy clouds, I call 'em.

104
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:17,676
For lack of a better name.

105
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,604
And we'll take a little bit of color,

106
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:37,420
and highlight these clouds.

107
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,555
Just across the top.

108
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,449
Just like the sunlight's
bouncing along here,

109
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:43,698
and playing and having fun.

110
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:47,284
There.

111
00:08:57,674 --> 00:08:59,658
Now we'll gently hypnotize these,

112
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:03,158
and Just bring 'em right into the picture.

113
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:05,075
There we go.

114
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,318
Now we'll take just a
little touch of Magic White.

115
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:18,923
We need a thin paint,
thin, thin paint here.

116
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:21,547
Be sure you're finished with
your sky when you do this,

117
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:24,619
'cause it's just about
over once you start this.

118
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:27,479
We'll put some little light
rays comin' through here.

119
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,896
Just indications.

120
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,648
Like you're bouncing through and playin'.

121
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:42,070
Just enough to give it a
little indication back here.

122
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:46,250
Now let's see, way back
here, very lightly.

123
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,418
Let's just make us a little
water line back in here.

124
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,554
Like so.

125
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,650
Thought we'd do like a nice
bay, or something like that.

126
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,062
The water's not violently rough.

127
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:06,933
Just nice, few little
ripples here and there.

128
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,183
Few little waves coming in.

129
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:17,215
Just work those around.

130
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:21,490
Now as we get up closer here,

131
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:26,875
let's have a little wave
in here, just like so.

132
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:32,329
Put this little darker
color in so it'll stand out.

133
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:40,736
Maybe just a little one back in here.

134
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,690
Little dark underneath these.

135
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:56,592
Now we take a little bit of white,

136
00:10:56,592 --> 00:11:00,675
little Magic White with
it, and we're gonna push.

137
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:06,528
Little bit of foam on top of that water.

138
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,850
Sort of pull that down.

139
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,183
And maybe here it's already curled over.

140
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:17,361
And we just lift that
right over like that.

141
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,357
A little bit in here.

142
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:47,743
Now if you're doing this
at home, when it dries,

143
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:51,347
take little dots of white
paint, and just lay all in here,

144
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,586
and it'll look like the
light's just sparkling,

145
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:54,696
right across the water,

146
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,872
with just little dots of white paint.

147
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,288
Don't over do it.

148
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,889
Just little foamy things happening

149
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:12,556
all throughout here.

150
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:22,692
Very light, we don't want
anything real bright back here.

151
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:39,945
Now then, I think I'll take
a little Alizarin Crimson,

152
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:44,112
and Sap Green mixed together
to make a nice brown color.

153
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:50,461
Warm, warm brown, since we've
used the Alizarin in here.

154
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:53,404
And brown is such a nice color,

155
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:56,177
it's a very warm, peaceful color.

156
00:12:56,177 --> 00:13:00,344
Maybe we'll put some little
things like this in here.

157
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:03,173
There we go.

158
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:09,560
Put some little grassy things,
layin' here on the beach.

159
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:15,569
There.

160
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:22,736
And let's take a little
bit of the Prussian Blue.

161
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:25,813
Maybe there's a little
place layin' right in here,

162
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:29,161
where the water sort of formed.

163
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:33,514
So we'll put just a little
more blue right here.

164
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,346
Like so.

165
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,649
There we go.

166
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:45,818
Now I'm gonna make a
mixture of brown and white.

167
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:54,468
And we'll make some
sand here on the beach.

168
00:13:58,265 --> 00:14:02,432
And we just let this knife
work right down through here.

169
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:04,942
Very gently.

170
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:16,168
Try to get the paint to break like that.

171
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:33,350
Maybe we'll go back right over here.

172
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,518
Maybe we'll have this coming
right down through here.

173
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:44,486
And we can start putting
all these little bushes

174
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:48,367
and weeds that grow out here on the sand.

175
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:52,451
This is still the Sap
Green and Alizarin Crimson.

176
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:58,947
There we go.

177
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:13,031
And follow the lay of the land here.

178
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,991
You want it to look like
it's sorta coming down.

179
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:17,338
If we're gonna have a
little pool of water here,

180
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,344
you need to have it coming down.

181
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:21,511
So it just works in there.

182
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,759
There we go.

183
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:36,625
And we can take and lay
a little bit of sand

184
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,625
right down through here.

185
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:50,969
Let's start with some
reflections in this water.

186
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:55,043
Little touch right here.

187
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,127
Let's build some nice little reflections

188
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:01,376
in this little pool that's laying here.

189
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:32,826
Now we come ahead and
decide where we want the

190
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,554
dirt to come.

191
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:37,637
Maybe it'll come right out like that.

192
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,292
Let's put a little thing right out here.

193
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,060
There we go.

194
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,142
Very lightly.

195
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,908
And we can bring some Over in here.

196
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:59,325
Maybe this one comes way off.

197
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,726
It would if I didn't run out of paint.

198
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:11,388
There we go.

199
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:14,236
Lay that in there.

200
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:33,921
Now we take a little bit of Magic White.

201
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,460
And we'll put some little things happening

202
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,876
around the water's edge here.

203
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,336
Just here and there.

204
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:54,269
Always have a lot of foam
that builds up around the sea.

205
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:58,436
So we'll just have all those
little foamy things in here.

206
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,498
Little bit over here.

207
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:11,740
So it looks like that
just sort of slips on

208
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,728
into the background there.

209
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,144
And off and away.

210
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:24,344
Now we can put a few more
little things in here,

211
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,177
just to build this up.

212
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:31,183
Still following the lay of the land.

213
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:45,951
Arighty.

214
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,108
Let's take some brown here.

215
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:54,932
I'm gonna put like an old snow fence,

216
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:57,611
coming down through here I think.

217
00:18:57,611 --> 00:19:00,555
So we'll start with
straight Van Dyke Brown.

218
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:02,805
And these old fences are...

219
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,679
Made out of just whatever
happens to be available.

220
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,795
So they're all different
sizes, all different shapes.

221
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,075
The wind and the weather,

222
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:16,939
they tear them apart and
they really get bad looking.

223
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,522
So we'll just lay them in here.

224
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,040
Some of 'em are just about to rot.

225
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:29,033
Maybe there's a little
short one right here.

226
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:33,599
Give him a little more, there.

227
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,599
This one over here, maybe
he just comes like so.

228
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:44,378
Every which way, ever which way.

229
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:08,526
And we'll just let these happen.

230
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,115
Sometimes they're close together,

231
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:18,282
sometimes they're far
apart, so wherever you want.

232
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:21,446
There.

233
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:30,899
And maybe one's just about to fall over,

234
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,065
there he goes.

235
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,446
Now I'll take a little touch
of the light color here,

236
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:41,363
and I'm gonna just put
a little touch of light.

237
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:46,891
Right on the edge of
these, just here and there.

238
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,899
This is just brown and white.

239
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:51,398
Just a little bit.

240
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:01,706
Those do look nice and old.

241
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:05,874
They've been hangin' around
the beach for a long time.

242
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:09,294
There we go.

243
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,705
Now take a little bit of paint here.

244
00:21:17,553 --> 00:21:21,720
And let's just make this old
thing just wander around.

245
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,929
IT's just about had it.

246
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,096
Come right on down, there.

247
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,895
Maybe this one has a
bunch on the other side,

248
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:36,133
so we just keep on cutting through.

249
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:38,049
Come through like this.

250
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:43,316
And let's give him one more.

251
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:47,149
That went so well let's
do another one, there.

252
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:55,570
Now if your really wanna
spruce these up a little bit,

253
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,658
you can put just a little bit on top here.

254
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:00,789
Let's use just a little
touch lighter color,

255
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,622
so it shows up, there.

256
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,255
Just a little light
playin' along the corner.

257
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:08,364
And use the small edge of this knife, too,

258
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:10,114
don't just use the...

259
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,455
Other edge.

260
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,538
Now then, let's...

261
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,712
Let's put a nice little tree right here.

262
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:24,732
We need an old, tired tree.

263
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:29,048
That's live right next to
the ocean all of it's life.

264
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,376
It's not the best place in the world

265
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:32,376
for an old tree to live.

266
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:37,372
There, boy he looks tired already.

267
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:42,154
LEt's give him another little helper here.

268
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,796
There we go.

269
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:56,124
Okay, let's use the
little liner brush here.

270
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:03,595
And just put some
highlights right along here.

271
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:08,538
Let those sort of fade back.

272
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,432
Give him a few more little branches.

273
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,972
This is just a thin oil.

274
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:25,861
That's mixed with a paint so
it's a little bit thinner.

275
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,945
And then it flows better.

276
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,009
He comes right along.

277
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,864
Like that.

278
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:41,951
And we just put a few
little limbs at random,

279
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:45,118
and then we'll put some leaves on him.

280
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,223
Maybe right in here,

281
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:49,865
maybe there's the one that's just tired,

282
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:51,365
he's hangin' down.

283
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,505
There.

284
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:00,055
Poor old tree.

285
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:04,988
Okay.

286
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:10,084
We'll take a little bit of...

287
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:13,417
Little Alizarin and the Sap Green again.

288
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,242
Maybe dull it down with
a little bit of brown,

289
00:24:17,242 --> 00:24:19,826
we don't want this very bright.

290
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:24,005
Alright, that's nice.

291
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,967
Just put some little leaves on here.

292
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:35,866
There we go.

293
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:39,426
Just drop the little rascals
on wherever you want 'em.

294
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:40,686
Maybe we'll just put these back,

295
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:43,625
and let this limb protrude on through.

296
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:47,209
Maybe he's already got
tired one on strike.

297
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,324
Just layin' out there by himself.

298
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,740
We'll take a little bit of...

299
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:58,371
Green, a little yellow.

300
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,115
And I put just a little touch
of brown with it to dull it.

301
00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:04,465
Once again, I don't want this
to be a bright, bright tree.

302
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:06,105
I want this to be quite dull.

303
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,855
Put a few little highlights here.

304
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
There we go.

305
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,481
Just here and there.

306
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:26,748
Alright.

307
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,400
We can go back and fill in some more

308
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,344
of these little busy areas.

309
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:36,677
Just to give him a little...

310
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:38,929
Character.

311
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:13,336
There, that's nice.

312
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:25,843
Take a little Alizarin
Crimson and brown here,

313
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:27,739
and maybe we'll just
put a few little things

314
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:29,634
that are trying to grow here.

315
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:30,810
Life's sort of rough out here,

316
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,144
so he's not doin' too great.

317
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,725
Just here and there.

318
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:44,627
Maybe there's one layin' over here.

319
00:26:58,095 --> 00:27:01,762
This is a very quiet little seascape.

320
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:03,855
Something you can do.

321
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,903
It's just a little practice,
and I think you'll enjoy it.

322
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:09,699
It's probably the most
fun working with a sky.

323
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,445
There's a multitude of
things you can do here.

324
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:14,189
There's no limit to the
different colors you can use,

325
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,881
you can change 'em to any
color that pleases you.

326
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:20,138
Feel free.

327
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:22,121
We're not trying to
teach you to copy here,

328
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:24,273
we're trying to teach you a technique.

329
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:27,850
And how you use that technique
is strictly up to you.

330
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:31,666
You're only limited by your imagination.

331
00:27:31,665 --> 00:27:35,309
So let it go, have fun with it, practice.

332
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:38,559
And you too can be an almighty painter.

333
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:43,347
I think we'll very
quickly sign this picture.

334
00:27:44,217 --> 00:27:47,653
And we'll call it finished, so
we'll take a little bit of...

335
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:48,987
Thin paint here.

336
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,504
Just do that.

337
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:57,028
I wanna thank you very very
much for watching us today,

338
00:27:57,028 --> 00:27:58,929
I hope you have enjoyed this picture,

339
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,701
it's a little different than
what we've done in the past.

340
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:05,867
But it gives you some more
ideas of what you can do.

341
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:10,080
Until next time, happy painting.

342
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,094
(guitar music)
