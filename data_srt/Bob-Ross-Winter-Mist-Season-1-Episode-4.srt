1
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,156
- Hello, glad to see you again.

2
00:00:04,155 --> 00:00:06,939
Today I thought we'd do
an almighty winter picture

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,931
and I want to put a great
of emphasis on the sky

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,245
and how we make big bellowy,
fluffy clouds that just

5
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:16,888
roll and lay up in the sky here.

6
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:19,582
So I've covered the
canvas with magic white

7
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:21,587
and I'm gonna start with
sort of a grey color here

8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,253
made by mixing a little Prussian blue,

9
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:25,864
a little brown and a little white

10
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:29,474
and we're just gonna
start gently working this

11
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:30,641
and let it go.

12
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:37,368
There we go, we just sort of
work it around and around here.

13
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:39,118
This is a winter sky.

14
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,009
Bad weather's coming in.

15
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:45,173
Okay, here we go.

16
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:57,597
Now we just sorta bring all this together.

17
00:00:57,597 --> 00:01:01,429
But we want this swirling
turning action here.

18
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,584
And then very lightly back in here.

19
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:11,096
Okay.

20
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:18,498
Now we'll take our fan brush
with a little bit of white

21
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:23,965
and we'll put just a touch of
permanent red with it here.

22
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,445
Okay, a little bit of magic white.

23
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:32,656
Now we're gonna start
way back in the back,

24
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:35,682
the cloud farthest away first.

25
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:38,192
And we'll start working this.

26
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,191
There we go.

27
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:43,867
(light piano music)

28
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:47,510
And you keep this brush
moving all the time.

29
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,677
Just let it dance and play
and have fun up through there.

30
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:59,186
Very gently we'll blend that.

31
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,759
Okay, now we're ready to start working it.

32
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:19,556
Always doing the thing,
it's farthest away first

33
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,223
and working forward.

34
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:28,116
There.

35
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:34,227
Then we'll hypnotize a
little bit, very gently,

36
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:36,129
we don't want to destroy
what we've worked so hard

37
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:40,129
to put in here, we just
wanna blend it together.

38
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:42,548
There.

39
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:52,743
Today I'm using two fan brushes,

40
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,030
one so I can work with the darks

41
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,814
and the other one with the lights.

42
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:59,784
We'll throw some ol' grey clouds in here

43
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:04,281
that are sneaking around
and having fun too.

44
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:05,532
There he comes.

45
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,549
And maybe there's an old
grey one just sorta laying

46
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,133
out here like this.

47
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:34,372
And we'll work this one
just a little touch.

48
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:44,044
And we'll go back into another
little white cloud here.

49
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:46,313
And by the time I've got down
this low I'm getting away

50
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,932
from the pink that I had, I
just want the pink in the top

51
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:53,099
to give indication that
sunlight's playing through there.

52
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,716
Then all these beautiful
clouds just happen

53
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,799
right up here in the sky.

54
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:10,246
Clouds used to be something
that drove me crazy

55
00:04:10,247 --> 00:04:12,167
when I was a traditional painter.

56
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:16,343
You'd work for days and days
to make big, fluffy clouds.

57
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:20,382
And here you just sorta let it
happen, don't worry about it.

58
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:22,463
Don't try to plan 'em.

59
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,879
Ah, there's another nice one.

60
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:28,233
'Cause clouds are free.

61
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,274
They have no boundaries.

62
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:32,941
They come and go as they please.

63
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,972
Okay, let's see.

64
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,805
Really pushing that paint into the canvas,

65
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:06,972
you wanna grind the value
right into the materials.

66
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:13,740
While we're talking about canvas,

67
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,867
one of the things to look for

68
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:19,433
when you're buying a canvas
to paint this technique

69
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:22,737
is look for a canvas
that's acrylic primed.

70
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:25,727
That'll hold the magic
white on there longer.

71
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,628
Keep it wet longer.

72
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:31,795
And we depend on this being
wet throughout the painting.

73
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:48,500
Okay, maybe there's another
little fluffy right in here.

74
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,670
Just wherever.

75
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,170
Just let it happen, don't worry about it.

76
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
There we go.

77
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,671
And here we're just putting
some brush strokes in.

78
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:09,672
Indicate light coming through there.

79
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:21,535
Okay, maybe laying up here in the clouds

80
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:25,701
we have some little mountains
that are just laying in here.

81
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:41,341
Okay, we want these to
blend right into nothing.

82
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:44,841
We're gonna lay these right in the clouds.

83
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:51,268
Okay, we'll have a little light
playing down through here.

84
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,723
Just bouncing around, having fun.

85
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:55,557
There.

86
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,233
Right up to this peak.

87
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:12,318
Want these to be far, far away

88
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,902
just about disappearing
right into the sky.

89
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,037
Then we're gonna diffuse them

90
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,122
by just tap, tap, tapping right along,

91
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:25,687
always following the angles here.

92
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:26,771
Just tapping.

93
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,829
And then we'll gently hypnotize them

94
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:34,996
so they just disappear right
on back into the picture.

95
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,668
Okay.

96
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:47,862
Now we can just lay clouds all around 'em.

97
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:50,112
Just set 'em down in there.

98
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:01,348
We'll work those a little bit.

99
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:18,397
Maybe a little touch of grey in here.

100
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:25,773
Okay.

101
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:32,599
Now when you're at home doing
this and have unlimited time,

102
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,386
you can put a great deal
more detail in here.

103
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:39,552
This is just to give you
an idea of how it's done.

104
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:41,337
Okay.

105
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,040
Let's have an almighty mountain.

106
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,624
Let's come all the way
down, what the heck.

107
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:54,068
He just comes right up through here.

108
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:02,930
Very little paint.

109
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:06,931
We're really pushing this
paint into the canvas.

110
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:24,139
Okay, then we'll take, pull that down.

111
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:28,139
Just makes the next layer
of paint stick better.

112
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:41,884
I'm gonna add just a little
touch of Prussian blue here.

113
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,293
Just so we have some
shadows under the snow.

114
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,203
Okay.

115
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:07,076
Now we can put some almighty snow

116
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:09,760
coming all the way down
through this mountain here.

117
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,291
And we're just gonna let it run and play.

118
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,542
Just let it go.

119
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,707
There.

120
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:43,342
See how easy that is?

121
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,509
Just let it flow in there.

122
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:50,939
And we'll run some right
along this mountain peak.

123
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:55,640
And maybe here since our
light's coming from here,

124
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,647
this one's gonna be highlighted
from the other side.

125
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:03,815
We'll create a little valley
maybe right down through there.

126
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:10,711
We can lay in some shadows
here using just some

127
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,711
Prussian blue and white.

128
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,492
There we go.

129
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:28,324
Any place you want a ridge to stand up,

130
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:31,100
all you have to do is lay
a shadow underneath it

131
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,018
and automatically it's right there.

132
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:41,148
Some shadows running down behind this one.

133
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:52,995
Okay.

134
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:58,343
Now, with a clean dry brush
I'm gonna diffuse this,

135
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:01,770
lay it in this mist, I want
this to be misty in the back.

136
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,437
Like it's very, very, very cold.

137
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,246
Where I live, in Fairbanks,
it's not unusual for it

138
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:11,726
to get 60 or 70 degrees below zero.

139
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,246
And it's always very, very misty.

140
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:18,413
We have ice fog that forms
and lays in between the trees.

141
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,190
It's cold but it's beautiful.

142
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,576
Mmkay.

143
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:29,553
Now, let's take here,

144
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,441
a little bit of the grey color

145
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:35,326
and I'm gonna lighten
it up just a little bit

146
00:12:35,326 --> 00:12:37,743
with a little titanium white.

147
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,390
There, nice color.

148
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,605
Load this brush full of paint

149
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:47,776
and we'll put a little tree
way back in the distance here.

150
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,346
And I thought today we'd
make these little trees

151
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:50,212
with the fan brush.

152
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,962
We can make them with a
fan brush, one inch brush,

153
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:55,129
two and a half inch brush.

154
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:59,712
Today I thought we'd do it with this.

155
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,396
And you want these to be very quiet.

156
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:07,044
Very subdued.

157
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:09,793
To give the illusion of distance.

158
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,806
Okay, maybe there's
another one right there.

159
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:28,875
And we can start laying in a
little bit of snow up here.

160
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:35,778
And see how that color comes through

161
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:39,278
and we use that to make the shadow effect.

162
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,692
Mmkay.

163
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,389
And as I say, I want to lay this in mist

164
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,556
so I'm just gonna gently tap this.

165
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:13,473
I want it to be far away and misty.

166
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:20,804
Now we'll come forward just a little bit,

167
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:23,803
drop in some more little trees here.

168
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:34,877
There we go.

169
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:37,095
Just go and forth with your fan brush

170
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:41,177
and you're sorta bending
these bristles downward.

171
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:54,201
And however many trees you want.

172
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,542
This is your world so

173
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:59,209
you can put as many
trees in it as you want.

174
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,571
But you notice, these
trees are a little darker

175
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,071
than the first ones we put in.

176
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:16,991
Mmkay.

177
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,841
Now, let's mist these
up just a little bit.

178
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:22,716
All I'm doing is just tapping.

179
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:24,966
Then I'll lift it a little.

180
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,168
And maybe we got a few
little bushes growing

181
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:41,001
right around here that
just covered with snow.

182
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:46,439
Okay.

183
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:51,653
So, we'll put some magic
white and some titanium white,

184
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,590
mix 'em together.

185
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,604
Thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

186
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:58,437
Then we'll just put these
little sparklers here,

187
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,104
just little snow covered bushes.

188
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:23,698
There we go.

189
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:29,798
And we'll put a few little sticks in here.

190
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,918
Mmkay, let's move over to this side

191
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,585
and see what we can put in here.

192
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:53,186
Trees are closer to you,

193
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:56,603
they're gonna be getting a little bigger.

194
00:16:58,523 --> 00:16:59,355
There.

195
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:06,246
And you need to,

196
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,545
when you're making these
evergreen trees here,

197
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:12,019
you need to leave spots
open in between the limbs.

198
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,566
Birds have got to have a place to sit

199
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,982
and wind's gotta get through.

200
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,763
Don't kill all those.

201
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:21,141
Get away from the little
Christmas tree things

202
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:24,808
we used to make when
we were kids in school.

203
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:38,082
Trees don't grow even,
they don't grow straight.

204
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:40,082
However makes them happy

205
00:17:40,957 --> 00:17:43,832
according to the weather, the conditions,

206
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:46,277
the amount of heat or cold.

207
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:50,027
All these things effect
the way a tree looks.

208
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,814
Okay.

209
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,168
Maybe we want one right in the front.

210
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:02,449
I just made this a little
darker so he stands out.

211
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,033
A little baby tree right there.

212
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:12,258
See, because he's a
little darker now he shows

213
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,443
otherwise he wouldn't show.

214
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:15,732
He'd just lay in there and be quiet

215
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:18,050
and you'd never know he was there.

216
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,967
Now we know he's there.

217
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,457
Gonna tap this just gently.

218
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:39,897
Okay.

219
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,595
And let's have this come down like this.

220
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:44,650
We'll just make another little thing

221
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,051
coming right down through here.

222
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,467
Change the angle.

223
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:56,256
Mmkay.

224
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,510
Pull that right through.

225
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,671
This is a very cold picture,

226
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:13,409
I may have to go get my
coat here in a second,

227
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:16,218
it's about to freeze me to death.

228
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:17,218
There we go.

229
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:31,802
And as you can see,
where the paint breaks,

230
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,303
shadows automatically happen in the snow.

231
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:38,185
It's very rare that snow is pure white.

232
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:40,147
You always have the shadows
and you have some dirt

233
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:44,064
that shows through and
all those little things.

234
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:50,118
Okay, we'll have some of those nice little

235
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:53,218
snow covered bushes on this side too.

236
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:56,219
Don't want this side to get jealous.

237
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,134
Okay, a little magic white,
a little plain white.

238
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,708
There we go.

239
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,047
Nice little snow covered bushes.

240
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:36,440
Maybe, if we had such a beautiful scene,

241
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,153
maybe we'd need a little cabin about here.

242
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,788
We have to have a little
hunter's cabin or something

243
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:42,133
right out through here.

244
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,951
So first I'll take and
scrape off the basic shape.

245
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:48,417
This gets rid of all this
loose paint, the thinner paint

246
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,912
so we'll have something to work on here.

247
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:52,123
And we'll take that off.

248
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:54,198
It's also a very good
way to lay in your cabin,

249
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:55,927
to work on a perspective and lay it out

250
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,259
exactly the way you want it.

251
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,635
And just a general shape.

252
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,701
The big thing is to get
the loose paint off.

253
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:09,825
Okay, now we'll take a
little Van Dyke brown

254
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:13,323
and we'll back this back eave back here.

255
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:15,656
Just like so, nice and dark.

256
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:17,882
There we go.

257
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:23,769
Then we'll lay a roof on here.

258
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,993
There.

259
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Just a little bitty cabin
out here in the woods.

260
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:42,095
Little snow on the other side.

261
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:48,355
Maybe the snow's pretty thick
so we'll lay it on there

262
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:51,189
nice and thick so it looks strong.

263
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,946
Then we'll put the front on.

264
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:01,438
Mmkay.

265
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,805
Son of a gun, there he comes.

266
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:21,108
Mmkay, let's make this an old cabin.

267
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:25,192
So we'll just make it
weather beaten, old boards.

268
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:35,156
Lay some shadows on top of that.

269
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,432
This is Van Dyke brown again,

270
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:38,008
I'm just sort of
alternating back and forth

271
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:42,174
between brown and white to
make it look very, very old.

272
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:45,279
This old hunter he...

273
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,052
He went out after moose, it was too big

274
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:49,053
and he ran off with him.

275
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,593
So the old cabin's just
standing here abandoned.

276
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:56,176
Better put a door on it though.

277
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:02,289
Maybe a passing hunter would
like to stay here overnight.

278
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:05,646
There we go.

279
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:08,635
And we'll make this an old slab cabin.

280
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:12,135
We'll just put some boards right in there.

281
00:23:24,626 --> 00:23:25,460
Mmkay.

282
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:40,695
And you can, if you wanna
push this back a little bit,

283
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:44,028
we can put a darker color on here first.

284
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,045
We'll just push this cabin right back into

285
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:51,634
the bushes a little bit and
we'll have some little bushes

286
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:54,050
growing right down like that.

287
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,186
Little big of magic.

288
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:13,562
Okay.

289
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:18,437
Maybe when this old fella lived here,

290
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:21,505
maybe he had a little fence that ran back.

291
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:24,573
He might've had an animal
or two he kept in here

292
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:27,323
so let's just put a little fence.

293
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:32,807
And this little fence is
running over the hill.

294
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:36,891
We'll just let it go right
on back over the hill.

295
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,293
Just see the top of that one.

296
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,358
And a little bit of highlight.

297
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:57,320
Then a little bit of
snow on top of the posts.

298
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,319
There we go.

299
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:08,815
Okay, then we can run
some wire right down this

300
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:12,231
and let it disappear right over the hill.

301
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:13,971
Like so.

302
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:27,232
Okay, maybe a couple little
bushes out here in the front.

303
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,895
And I think we need some icicles.

304
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:34,421
So we'll use just straight magic white

305
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:38,084
and we'll pull down some
little icicles here.

306
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:42,250
Using the liner brush, this
is a number two script liner.

307
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,478
Whew, it's getting colder already.

308
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:53,350
Mmkay.

309
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,784
Let's move out the snow a little.

310
00:25:56,784 --> 00:26:00,951
And let's put a few more
little sticks here and there.

311
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:05,416
Mmkay.

312
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,875
This is truly an almighty mountain.

313
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:18,836
There we go, few little
sticks here and there.

314
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:26,400
Maybe here and there
are little indications.

315
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:31,294
Mmkay.

316
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:37,454
Just here and there,
we don't wanna overdo.

317
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:40,070
We want this to look
very soft, very misty,

318
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,237
far, far away.

319
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:44,047
Mmkay.

320
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,400
Take a little thin oil here.

321
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,523
And we'll just sign this
happy little picture.

322
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,989
And I hope in the last 30
minutes we have shown you

323
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:02,769
something that you can do very quickly.

324
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,568
A way to make some almighty
clouds, almighty mountains.

325
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:10,193
Some fantastic things using
very, very limited pallet.

326
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,117
We've used mostly blue, brown
and white in this picture;

327
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:15,114
almost nothing else at all.

328
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:16,949
But it's a very effective picture

329
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,421
and it has a tremendous sky.

330
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,094
You can work on this sky.

331
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:21,869
Once again, you have
unlimited time at home.

332
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:24,240
You can take this sky to points

333
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,852
that are almost unbelievable.

334
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,752
You can work it, you can
alternate between darks and lights

335
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:29,790
in the sky.

336
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,692
You can make skies that almost
look like religious skies,

337
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:36,124
that things are gonna come through.

338
00:27:36,124 --> 00:27:40,248
Practice it, work with
it, don't give up on it.

339
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:44,753
All you need is a dream in here
that you wanna put on there.

340
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:48,052
And we thank you very, very
much for being with us today.

341
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:51,104
Once again, if you have
questions, if you have comments,

342
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,780
feel free to drop us a line.

343
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,399
We'll be glad to answer
any question that we can.

344
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,509
From all of us here, happy painting.

345
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,759
Thank you very, very much for watching.

346
00:28:03,678 --> 00:28:07,011
(relaxing guitar music)
