1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,868
- Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,798
I'm certainly glad you
could join me today.

3
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:04,748
I thought today we'd just do a

4
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:06,190
fantastic little seascape.

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,419
I'll show you how easy
you can do one of those.

6
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:09,487
Let's start out and have them run

7
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:10,862
all the colors across the screen

8
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:12,600
that you need to paint along with me.

9
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,508
While they're doing that,

10
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:14,851
let me show you what I've got done.

11
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:16,548
Have my regular old canvas up here,

12
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:19,448
except today I've covered
the bottom part of it here

13
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:21,774
and up the side, with Black Gesso.

14
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:24,515
And I've allowed that to dry completely.

15
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:26,606
And after it's dry, be sure it's dry,

16
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:28,878
it takes about 30 - 40
minutes for it to dry.

17
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:30,670
And it's totally different
now than Liquid Black.

18
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,965
This is Black Gesso, which is an acrylic.

19
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,077
Then we've taken transparent color.

20
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:37,559
I've put a little Alizarin Crimson

21
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,397
and Dark Sienna mixture in here.

22
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:42,668
And a little Sap Green
and brown down in here.

23
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,110
Down here is just a little brown.

24
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,268
The white part we've covered,
as usual, with Liquid White.

25
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:50,934
So it's completely wet and ready to go.

26
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:52,748
So let's just have some fun today.

27
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,443
I'm gonna start out with
the old two-inch brush.

28
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:57,943
We'll go into the least little
touch of the Indian Yellow.

29
00:00:57,942 --> 00:00:59,968
Just a small amount.

30
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,664
And we'll go right up here.

31
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:04,310
And let's just dance in
a happy little sky today.

32
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,310
Let's do a seascape that's very
bright and shiny and pretty.

33
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:12,966
There we go, little Cad Yellow.

34
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,340
Vary the yellows here.

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,497
Started with Indian Yellow,
now we're into Cad Yellow.

36
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:20,814
Shoot, now I'm gonna go into
a little bit of Yellow Ochre.

37
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:25,688
And Yellow Ochre's sort of a
gold color, it's very pretty.

38
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:27,507
Very pretty color, I like it.

39
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:30,884
We just let it come right on around,

40
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:33,135
maybe something like that.

41
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,576
Wherever, just make some decisions.

42
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:38,340
Then we'll take a little of the Bright Red

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,112
and we have not cleaned the brush yet.

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,954
I like these kind of paintings
where I don't have to

45
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:46,286
clean the brush much, I'm
sort of a lazy painter.

46
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:48,057
There.

47
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:50,873
But by allowing these
colors to blend on the brush

48
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:52,510
and on the canvas, you get a multitude of

49
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,907
different values and colors,

50
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,697
rather than just one old flat color.

51
00:01:56,697 --> 00:02:00,204
Shoot, put some excitement in your world.

52
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,605
There we go.

53
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:05,587
I tell you what, let's just paint it

54
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:07,251
all the way down here to the water line.

55
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,829
This is just a little
piece of masking tape

56
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,110
I have across here.

57
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,195
Just to keep the water line straight.

58
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:15,330
There.

59
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,144
Sometimes my hand's a little shaky,

60
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:20,432
so I need all the help I can get.

61
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:23,552
So we just use a little
piece of masking tape.

62
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:26,227
You don't have to have that
there, if you don't want it.

63
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:27,820
Just makes it a little easier.

64
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:31,115
Gently, gently blend all these together.

65
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,897
Maybe I'll put a little
of that color on the brush

66
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:35,185
up here too, just to fill in the sky.

67
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:38,604
Just blend it all together.

68
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:40,492
So you can't tell where one color stops

69
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,268
and the next color starts.

70
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,612
There we go.

71
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:48,048
And you can make this
brighter or duller, whatever.

72
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,680
(brush rubbing across the canvas)

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,980
Okay.

74
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,923
Now then, let me grab another brush.

75
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,618
I have several brushes going,

76
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,945
so I don't have to spend
all my time washing them.

77
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:59,548
I'm gonna go right into
a little Titanium White.

78
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:00,711
Pure Titanium White.

79
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:03,100
Right up here, I'm gonna
put a little of this white.

80
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,812
I wanna make a bright spot in this sky.

81
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,670
It won't look all that
bright at this point,

82
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,236
but it will when we get
a little further along.

83
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:12,716
There.

84
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:15,395
(brush sweeping across canvas)

85
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,247
Just really give a nice sparkle up here.

86
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:20,481
Okay.

87
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:25,819
Maybe, maybe ... I didn't
realize how much I said that,

88
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,123
till a little boy one
day, about ten years old,

89
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:30,001
began mocking me.

90
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:30,929
He was walking around saying,

91
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:32,742
"Maybe, maybe, maybe."

92
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,021
(Bob snickers)

93
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:36,411
All right, I'm gonna make up
a little lavender color here,

94
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:40,283
using Alizarin Crimson and Phthalo Blue.

95
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:42,448
Much, much more crimson than blue.

96
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:43,984
Something like so.

97
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,790
Let me clean off the old knife.

98
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:49,295
And here's a dirty brush,
we'll just use that.

99
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,132
Has a little of that sky color on it.

100
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:53,796
I'm just gonna tap the bristles into that.

101
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:55,407
(brush tapping on palette)

102
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:58,031
Just tap a little bit, like so.

103
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:00,719
Let's go up in here and let's
make some nice little clouds

104
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:04,549
that just float around
and have fun all day.

105
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,677
Just sorta wind 'em up
and put 'em in there, see.

106
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,352
There.

107
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,115
Okay.

108
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:15,395
Wherever you think they should be.

109
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:17,485
(brush swishing on canvas)

110
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:18,670
I'm gonna just have 'em
come right over here.

111
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,312
This is gonna be a big cliff, I think.

112
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:23,818
A big rocky thing lives right there.

113
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,686
Just drop it in.

114
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:29,906
All right, there we go.

115
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:31,649
And by using these little twisting

116
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,718
or circular patterns here, it creates

117
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,776
a multitude of little
things happening up here.

118
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,336
It's not just a flat ol' dead sky.

119
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:40,399
Lot of nice things going on.

120
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,254
There.

121
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:43,951
Okay.

122
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:46,294
Maybe we'll come right over in here.

123
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:49,384
And I'm just gonna put clouds
all over the sky like this.

124
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,283
Okay, there we are.

125
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,356
Maybe it comes right down.

126
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,939
Just load a little more color.

127
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,308
There.

128
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:04,389
Maybe there's a little
protrusion right out here.

129
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,292
Wherever you want 'em.

130
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,475
There.

131
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:10,500
I tell you what, while I'm doing this,

132
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,238
because this is going
to take just a second.

133
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:14,307
I wanna show you one
of my little characters

134
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,576
that's living with me now.

135
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:18,968
I have three little baby
squirrels that I'm raising

136
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,461
and they are they cutest little devils.

137
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:23,245
We took a little video of 'em,

138
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:25,730
and I wanna share that with
you while I'm doing this.

139
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,139
And I won't do anything
I don't tell you about

140
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,651
while that's coming on there.

141
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,326
Now these are tiny little baby ones.

142
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:34,926
They're just beginning
to get a little fur.

143
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:41,307
I've had them now since just
after their eyes opened.

144
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,788
These little rascals
are hungry continually.

145
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:47,766
So, I thought I'd show
you how we feed 'em.

146
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:52,150
To do that, we take ... I
just use a little syringe,

147
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,424
with a little nipple on the end of it.

148
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,419
It's just like goin' to the
doctor and gettin' your shot

149
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,669
when it's feeding time here.

150
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,391
We fill'er up and normally though,

151
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:04,916
when you see a syringe comin' at you,

152
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:09,844
sorta scares you a little
bit, but in this case,

153
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:14,845
when my little friends here
see a syringe coming at 'em,

154
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,372
they get excited.

155
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:18,908
This just makes their whole day.

156
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:21,908
It's hard to get 'em
to eat, as you can see.

157
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:23,764
(Bob laughing)

158
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:26,463
I think they'll eat
about every 15 minutes,

159
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:27,946
if you'd feed 'em.

160
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,624
I have three of those little rascals now

161
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,706
and they live with me,
and my mother and I,

162
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:38,610
and Nancy, we all take care
of these little devils.

163
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,437
They're gonna soon be big enough

164
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:42,788
to turn loose and let 'em go.

165
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:43,832
There.

166
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,529
I'm just putting in a few
little clouds down here,

167
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:48,848
while you was watching
the little squirrels.

168
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:50,704
Still just using the corner of the brush

169
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:55,535
and just making little circular patterns.

170
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:58,298
Just round and around and around we go.

171
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,922
Just sorta stir it up.

172
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:04,260
Just stir it up, is all we're
trying to do at this point.

173
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,033
But we don't want a lot
of paint on the canvas.

174
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,418
All we're looking for is a little stain.

175
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:10,465
There.

176
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:13,992
Sometimes you can just decide where

177
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,157
it should be a little
darker, a little lighter.

178
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:19,015
Shoot, maybe there's
even a little projection

179
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,160
that comes right out through there.

180
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,088
See, that easy.

181
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:22,903
Just by tapping.

182
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,913
You can make all those little things.

183
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,364
Okay.

184
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,637
Grabbing another clean brush.

185
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:32,216
This is clean, has nothing on it.

186
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:33,420
It's very dry.

187
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,937
And with that, you can just
begin blending this now.

188
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:39,766
To any degree of softness
or harshness that you want.

189
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,151
Just blend it.

190
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,111
Aren't those little squirrels cute?

191
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:46,309
I really like those little devils.

192
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:48,218
They're so much fun.

193
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,741
You spend a little time with
one of these, and it certainly

194
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,442
makes you appreciate nature
and all of God's wisdom

195
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,012
when He created these little characters.

196
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,689
You get addicted to 'em.

197
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,310
Especially my young friends.

198
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,976
I have a lot of children that
live around where I live,

199
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,726
and I let 'em come over and help me

200
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:11,339
feed the little squirrels and
look at 'em, and hold 'em.

201
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:15,292
I think everybody should
have the opportunity

202
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,480
to make friends with a
little guy like that.

203
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,427
If you do, you'll certainly
have a greater appreciation

204
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:24,401
of nature and all the little things

205
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,766
that are runnin' around that we don't

206
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,829
pay a lot of attention to.

207
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:29,488
There we go.

208
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:30,320
Now then.

209
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,021
(brush banging)

210
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:33,094
Just knockin' off the excess paint.

211
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:38,094
Very gently, very gently,
we can just blend that.

212
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:42,288
But isn't that a fantastic
way of making a sky that's ...

213
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,748
(soft delighted exclamation)

214
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:46,788
Sun gonna jump out and get you.

215
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:47,633
And you can do that.

216
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:49,122
(brush banging)

217
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:51,779
All right, time to wash your brush.

218
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,605
And as you now, we wash our brushes

219
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:55,120
just with odorless thinner.

220
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,347
(banging brush)

221
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:57,328
(Bob laughing)

222
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,791
Just beat the devil out of 'em.

223
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,032
Maybe I'll wash two, I dirtied up

224
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,651
several while we were doing that.

225
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,853
(brush slapping and banging)

226
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:06,980
That's double your pleasure.

227
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:10,153
Okay, now the little piece
of masking tape right here.

228
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:11,227
Let's take it off.

229
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:12,528
(masking tape peeling)

230
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,777
See, now that leaves you with

231
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:17,605
a very straight, smooth horizon.

232
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,184
But there was no color
under that, so I'll take

233
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,256
a little bit of the crimson
and little Dark Sienna.

234
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:25,597
I'm just gonna, probably
this won't even show up,

235
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:29,227
but I'm just scrubbing a little
transparent color on there.

236
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:31,054
Just bringin' that all together.

237
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:36,797
This is just the crimson
and a little Dark Sienna.

238
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:40,937
There, right up to the water line.

239
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:43,657
Okay, just sorta blend it together.

240
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:45,513
(brush sweeping across the canvas)

241
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:47,066
All right.

242
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:51,506
Now then, we have to make
some big major decisions here.

243
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:54,236
You know me, I like to have
these big crashing waves.

244
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:57,351
I don't like just doing
these little subdued waves,

245
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,420
but if you like those, you
can do those the same way

246
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:02,225
as we do the little waves
in the back, very simply.

247
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:05,201
Maybe, in our world, our
wave's gonna live right here.

248
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:08,198
You can take a fan brush or filbert brush

249
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,289
and just make sort of
a little outline of ...

250
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:11,530
(swooshing sound)

251
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,443
There.

252
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:15,206
That's gonna be our wave, right there.

253
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:20,206
Now then, with a little
touch of the Titanium White,

254
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:22,413
and I'm using a number three fan brush.

255
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,009
I'm gonna go right up here to
the horizon and just begin.

256
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,596
Come up close right here.

257
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:31,145
I'm just making strokes
where I'm going like this.

258
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:34,836
I'm really exaggerating, but like that.

259
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:38,858
I'm exaggerating, but it looks like

260
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:41,509
little watery things back here.

261
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:43,995
There.

262
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:47,808
Okay, now that's one of the nicest,

263
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:50,592
easiest, simplest little
ways that I've ever found

264
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:53,025
just to make the indication
of water back in there.

265
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,955
I'm gonna add the least
little touch of Cad Yellow

266
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:57,144
to my color right in here.

267
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:58,625
Oh, that's nice.

268
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,343
That's beginning to sparkle.

269
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:01,918
Little bit more.

270
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:06,782
See it looks like light, just
shining right across there.

271
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,384
There we go.

272
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:14,076
This is just some background material.

273
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:17,005
Now then, let me wash the old brush.

274
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,189
(paint thinner splashing)

275
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,067
(brush tapping and wiping dry)

276
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,039
Now the fun part, right in here.

277
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,117
That's the eye of the wave.

278
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,061
We'll just take some Titanium White

279
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:32,016
and just, as my son Steve says,

280
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,892
"Just mush it in there."

281
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,004
Really push it in there hard.

282
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:38,779
You can do this several times.

283
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:42,886
If it gets like there's a
lot of color underneath,

284
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:46,715
remove that excess paint
and that remains there.

285
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:49,369
That color remains there.

286
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,552
We can take a little more of our white,

287
00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:55,394
add a little of the Cad Yellow to that.

288
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:57,047
Go right back in here, see there.

289
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:59,180
Each time you do that
it'll get lighter in value.

290
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,123
Or you can take a rag or
something and just wipe that out.

291
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:04,248
Whichever way you'd like to do it.

292
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:08,727
Maybe it comes right on back, like so.

293
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:10,934
Just scrub it in.

294
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:12,043
Now then.

295
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,462
(brush banging)

296
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:14,882
Clean, dry, two-inch brush.

297
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,155
I'm only gonna use the top corner

298
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,202
and you put it there and you just

299
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:22,451
sort of wind it up, just wiggle it.

300
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:24,634
There.

301
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:27,650
You can make this as smooth as silk.

302
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,371
So smooth.

303
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,000
But there's not a lot of movement.

304
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,780
You're sorta just going around
in little tight circles.

305
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:38,402
There we go.

306
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,335
Then begin thinking about how
you want your water to flow.

307
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:45,074
(brush sweeping across canvas)

308
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,498
There.

309
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:48,738
(brush banging)

310
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:50,747
Knock off that excess paint.

311
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:54,240
That's an easy way of just
about getting your brush clean,

312
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,513
without going through
that whole procedure.

313
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:58,412
(brush scrubbing canvas)

314
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,102
There.

315
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:01,893
Okay.

316
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:05,818
Let me find a fan brush here,
got several of them going.

317
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,261
Maybe, in our world, we want to have

318
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:12,372
this water crashing over something.

319
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:16,011
Grab it and pull, think
about the angle though.

320
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,876
Angles are very important.

321
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:20,031
Very important.

322
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,056
Think about that water.

323
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,357
(makes wave sound, laughs)

324
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:23,380
Make those little noises.

325
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,164
That really helps.

326
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:27,156
There.

327
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:30,014
Just think about it crashing over.

328
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:32,794
That's all that we need at this point.

329
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,307
Now, if you want to bring some of that

330
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:36,683
dark back with a clean brush,

331
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,991
you can just grab it and lift it upward.

332
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:42,504
That'll very gently blend it all together.

333
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:44,950
See there.

334
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,370
You can work back and
forth, until you get it

335
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,576
exactly the way that you want it.

336
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:53,322
Okay, let me go back and get my

337
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:54,571
little number three fan brush.

338
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:55,713
I like this little fan brush.

339
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:58,591
It's good for makin' little foamy things,

340
00:13:58,591 --> 00:13:59,971
and stuff like that.

341
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,403
Take a little white and
then I'm going into that

342
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:05,130
nice lavender color we used in the sky.

343
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:10,560
Make sort of a medium value lavender.

344
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:13,444
Okay, let's go back up in here.

345
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:17,210
Now then, let's start thinking about

346
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,622
having some nice foam out here.

347
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:23,333
Just using the corner of the
fan brush, and once again,

348
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,328
you can do this with a
filbert, just as well.

349
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:28,815
The little number six filbert
brush would work just as well.

350
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:31,802
I just happened to have
this, so we'll use it.

351
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:35,022
All we're doing here is
putting in some shadows.

352
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:37,334
Some nice dark areas for the foam.

353
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,274
Think about the water
churning and bubbling

354
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:42,240
and splashing and carrying on.

355
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,477
(makes wave noise)

356
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:44,831
Crashing.

357
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:48,711
Maybe it comes right
over here, I don't know.

358
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,959
Wherever you want it.

359
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,545
Okay, I'm gonna wash that old brush.

360
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,628
(paint thinner splashing)

361
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,600
I like to do seascapes.

362
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,693
They're a lot of fun and they'll force you

363
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:03,594
to study water and how it
moves and churns, and etc.

364
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:04,543
Go to the ocean.

365
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:08,650
Or get a video, or photographs
of water, just study.

366
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,807
If you don't live near the
ocean, then look in books

367
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:14,601
and videos and stuff like that,
and you can see all of this.

368
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,129
Now, I've got just Titanium
White and I'm going

369
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:20,380
right up here on top of this darker color.

370
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,365
Just gonna take the fan brush here

371
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:26,911
and scrub in a little highlight.

372
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:29,445
Wipe the brush off when you load it,

373
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:31,877
so you have nice, clean color.

374
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,929
There.

375
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:38,958
Just wipe it on a paper towel in between.

376
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,012
Think about that water, hittin'
and splashin' and churning.

377
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:46,585
Make up little stories
and sounds in your mind

378
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:48,793
and just let it happen.

379
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:50,512
Let it happen.

380
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:51,791
There.

381
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,292
(brush scrubbing)

382
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:56,528
Now then, back to our large brush.

383
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:57,605
(brush banging)

384
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,227
I use the large brush,
only because it seems

385
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:02,544
to have a little more hair
in it, and it blends better.

386
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,637
You could do this with a one-inch
brush, if you would like.

387
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:09,562
I'm sort of hung up on this ol'
big brush, but try 'em both.

388
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:11,717
See which one works the best for you.

389
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:13,698
That's the one you are to use.

390
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,835
Maybe over here, a little
bit right in here too.

391
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,454
Just that nice churning.

392
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:25,298
Maybe there's even a little,
splashin' down like that.

393
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:26,572
Whatever.

394
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,139
There.

395
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,459
That ol' water is comin'
down through here.

396
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,311
I'm gonna add the least
little touch of Phthalo Blue

397
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:43,783
into that color.

398
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:45,841
I want a little bluish
... oh, that's nice.

399
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:48,166
That is nice, I like that.

400
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,532
Begin thinking about how
your water is coming up.

401
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,678
Right up in this transparency, or the eye.

402
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,263
Just Phthalo Blue and white, once again.

403
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:01,149
There.

404
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,142
Maybe it comes down here and ...

405
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:03,664
(wave noise)

406
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:07,062
Think about shape though.

407
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:10,545
Maybe there's a nice ...

408
00:17:10,545 --> 00:17:12,827
Shoot, maybe there's something right here.

409
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:15,966
Let that water come up and fall over.

410
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,980
We're creating a trough
or a valley in here.

411
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:22,725
Okay, here it comes.

412
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,339
There.

413
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:28,873
Just wherever.

414
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:32,149
(brush scrubbing canvas)

415
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:35,299
Little bit more of the
Phthalo Blue and white.

416
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:41,826
There.

417
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:46,431
Just let that splash and curl.

418
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,873
(makes splashing sound)

419
00:17:48,873 --> 00:17:51,495
Big things comin' down through here.

420
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:56,673
This is what gives shape
and form to your wave.

421
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:58,935
I tell you, maybe, even in here,

422
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:01,303
let's just use the corner of the brush.

423
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:04,644
Maybe the water's splashing,
crashing right along in here.

424
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:07,309
There may be another
little splasher in there.

425
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:08,591
Who knows?

426
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:10,256
This is your world, so you can do

427
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,521
anything that you want to do.

428
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,679
Anything that you want to do.

429
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,401
Let me take a large brush.

430
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,587
and just sort of blend that together.

431
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:22,080
We're beginning to get
into little bit of that

432
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,593
Sap Green and Van Dyke Brown
stuff that's down here.

433
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,239
All right, let me get the liner brush out.

434
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,421
I like that little liner brush.

435
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:39,722
We'll take that.

436
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:42,302
I wanna go into a little bit
of that same lavender color

437
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,343
that had a little white in it,
same color we have up here.

438
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:47,336
Let's just sorta highlight this edge here,

439
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,384
with a little color.

440
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,867
Make it nice and firm.

441
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:55,730
Then begin putting in some little shapes.

442
00:18:57,198 --> 00:19:02,023
Just some little doers in there that

443
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,674
create all the little shapes

444
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,413
and stuff that you want in here.

445
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:08,843
Paint thinner with a little
color, is all I have here.

446
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:14,392
Use a little of that
blue and white in here.

447
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:15,698
This is where you can begin

448
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:18,278
putting in all kinds of little details.

449
00:19:19,979 --> 00:19:21,423
At home you have unlimited time.

450
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:24,410
You can really set and make beautiful

451
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,073
little things in there, put
all those little details.

452
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:35,140
While I've got that
going, maybe back in here

453
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,783
you can see all these little doers.

454
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:43,642
Little Titanium White
with paint thinner on it.

455
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:44,847
Highlight some of the brighter ones,

456
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,048
where you think light would hit.

457
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:49,375
There.

458
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:54,086
As I say, these little details is what

459
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:58,005
really will make your
seascape spectacular.

460
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:00,329
Now then.

461
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:03,742
Okay.

462
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,115
Reach down here, get a little

463
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:10,740
touch more of that paint thinner.

464
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,881
Just let some of these little things

465
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:14,711
wiggle and jiggle and your hand shake.

466
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,011
I've had people write and tell me

467
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:17,707
they had a little nervous
twitch in their hand,

468
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,567
they had a hard time painting.

469
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,980
Sometimes, that's a very valuable asset.

470
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,593
Use it to your advantage.

471
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,799
There.

472
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:36,426
Tell you what.

473
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:38,793
Let's have some fun.

474
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:42,165
Now, this big ledge up here,

475
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:43,586
I've already covered that
with a little bit of brown,

476
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,005
as I mentioned earlier.

477
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:49,719
Let's take a little Dark Sienna,

478
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:53,665
grab a little white, Alizarin Crimson.

479
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:55,201
Just sorta mix those loosely.

480
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:56,353
I'm just gonna mix 'em on a brush.

481
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:57,964
Maybe even a little touch
of the Yellow Ochre.

482
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,259
Not much, just a little.

483
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,773
Okay, just on the fan brush.

484
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:03,244
Let's go up here.

485
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:05,992
Let's begin thinking about shapes here.

486
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:08,435
All you have to do is just tap.

487
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,611
Take the fan brush and tap.

488
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:13,528
That's really all it amounts to.

489
00:21:13,528 --> 00:21:17,677
And you can begin forming your rocks.

490
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:21,798
Just by tapping, just tap.

491
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:24,284
In here and there you can
add a little light color.

492
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:28,349
Wherever you think light would
strike and bounce and play.

493
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:30,022
There.

494
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,876
Leave some dark areas in here.

495
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:36,876
Dark areas will end up being
big holes in the rocks.

496
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,909
Little place for the seagulls to go.

497
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,074
They gotta have a place to build a nest.

498
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:46,269
In Alaska, we have little puffins.

499
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:49,820
They're one of the cutest
little birds God's ever made.

500
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,785
Looks like their beak's
too big for their head.

501
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:55,084
Beautiful little birds.

502
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:57,745
There.

503
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,371
But just form these, just like so.

504
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,761
And you could do this with a knife.

505
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,778
I just want to show you several
different ways of doing it.

506
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:09,933
But the knife will work very well

507
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,860
for making very nice rock effects.

508
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:17,553
There, try to stand out of
the way so you can see there.

509
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:22,901
Maybe this comes right on down
into here somewhere, like so.

510
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:25,317
I got several fan brushes going,

511
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:26,576
let me get another one here.

512
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:29,007
I want a rock on the other side too.

513
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:30,447
Right there.

514
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:32,260
(whooshing sound)

515
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,343
I bet you knew I was going to
put a rock there, didn't you?

516
00:22:35,343 --> 00:22:39,322
I always like big rocks,
big trees in my paintings.

517
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:41,635
Just sorta decide how you think that

518
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:44,942
old rock should live in
there, and drop it in.

519
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:48,608
We can take some of that color,

520
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:52,846
come right along in here, and once again,

521
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:55,374
this is a nice way of outlining

522
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,178
and forming your stones and rocks.

523
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:02,454
There.

524
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:05,198
(brush tapping canvas)

525
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,376
I want this one to remain quite dark.

526
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:11,368
Quite dark, so it doesn't
distract too much.

527
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,345
There we go.

528
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:20,345
Now you can take a clean,
dry, two-inch brush

529
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:25,239
and very gently, just caress it.

530
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,824
Just caress it.

531
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:29,967
It'll blend all that together.

532
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,524
Make it nice and smooth,

533
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:35,235
and it looks like beautiful stones then.

534
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:37,520
But very, very gently.

535
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,740
One hair and some air.

536
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:43,861
There.

537
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:47,254
Little bit of our Phthalo Blue and white.

538
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:50,023
We'll have a little splash,
comin' round down through here.

539
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:52,271
(makes soft splashing sound)

540
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:55,313
Shoot, maybe there's even a
little water drippin' down.

541
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:59,100
You could do this with a
liner brush or the fan brush.

542
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:01,019
Just whatever.

543
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,460
Maybe there's even a ...

544
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,324
(makes wave sound)

545
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:05,277
Right there.

546
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:10,277
Look at there, let that
come right on back, like so.

547
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,220
See, just bring it all together.

548
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,535
Then a little bit in the foreground.

549
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:24,233
These seascapes are not
near as hard as they look.

550
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,672
You really can do these.

551
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:28,750
Maybe, let's get crazy.

552
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,585
We have a second cleft here, so we'll put

553
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:32,697
a little stone right here too.

554
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:35,707
I just like to have stones
all out in the water.

555
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:41,197
I like it, it just enhances my paintings.

556
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:44,824
Little bit of the nice highlight color.

557
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,733
Let's see here, we could
take the liner brush,

558
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:50,291
little of that Phthalo Blue and white,

559
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,948
and paint thinner.

560
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,031
Thin it down and you can
literally have water dripping,

561
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,316
right off these rocks, just like so.

562
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:01,089
Let some of this just ...

563
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:02,739
(makes wave sound)

564
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,258
Put all these little things in.

565
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,019
It's a super way though, of making

566
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:13,734
very effective little seascapes like this.

567
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,480
There.

568
00:25:19,695 --> 00:25:23,491
Okay, little bit right in there.

569
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:27,582
Just make decisions,
where you think the water

570
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:31,820
would be churnin' and splashin',
maybe all around this rock.

571
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,770
Just using the corner
of the fan brush though.

572
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,086
That's all we're using.

573
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:39,264
All back in here there would be.

574
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:42,335
We'll have some churning
back against that big rock.

575
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:47,247
Little misty areas, like so.

576
00:25:50,185 --> 00:25:53,841
And you can just keep on and on and on.

577
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:56,844
But there comes a time
when we have to stop.

578
00:25:56,844 --> 00:26:00,394
I tell you what, we'll just take a touch,

579
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,677
a little touch of dark color.

580
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:04,995
We'll put one little lonely bird up here.

581
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,118
Little "m" bird.

582
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:11,691
And I think with that,

583
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:13,313
we'll call this ol' painting finished.

584
00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:14,390
Hope this gives you an idea

585
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,619
of how to do a fantastic seascape at home.

586
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,911
If you give it a try, you will love it.

587
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,002
And I'd love to see some
photographs of what you're doing.

588
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:23,092
If you have time, drop us a line.

589
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:24,373
Let us know if you like the show.

590
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,859
Send us some pictures
of what you're doing.

591
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:28,639
From all of us here, I'd like to wish you

592
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,823
happy painting and God bless, my friend.
