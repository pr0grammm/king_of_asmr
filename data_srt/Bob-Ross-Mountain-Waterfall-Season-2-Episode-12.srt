1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:03,677
- Hello, here we are again, ready to go.

2
00:00:03,677 --> 00:00:04,889
Hope you have the easel set up

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:06,785
and your almighty palette ready,

4
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:09,201
we'll paint a fantastic
little picture together.

5
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:11,437
I'm gonna have them quickly
run across the screen here

6
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:13,707
all the colors that we
have on the palette,

7
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,307
so if you haven't caught those
in one of the previous shows,

8
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:18,900
you can pick up all the
colors that we're using.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,466
I thought today we'd do a very
quick happy little waterfall.

10
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:23,332
Last week if you were
with us we did a waterfall

11
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:25,439
that was way off in the distance,

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,278
this time I think we'll do one
that's a little bit closer.

13
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,111
So I'm gonna start today

14
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:32,195
with a little tiny bit of thalo blue,

15
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:35,997
and I'll mix a little
Van Dyke brown with it,

16
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:40,233
and we'll just throw in
a quick little sky here,

17
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:42,234
something about like so.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,055
And, while I have the blue on the brush,

19
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:50,581
I'll go right into a
little bit of thalo green,

20
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:54,499
and we'll put some water
in here, there we are,

21
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:59,596
just to give us some nice
little water indications.

22
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:04,992
OK, now, let's wash the brush real quick,

23
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:07,242
and we'll move right along.

24
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,168
OK, now we'll go into a tiny
bit of alizarin crimson,

25
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,339
let's just warm this up a little,

26
00:01:14,338 --> 00:01:18,415
we'll put just a tiny bit
of crimson right here.

27
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:22,668
A little crimson, we don't
want to set the sky on fire,

28
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:26,256
just want to give it a nice, warm glow.

29
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:28,588
A little bit into the water.

30
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:31,085
There.

31
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:33,718
Now let's bring all this together.

32
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,318
Just using little criss-cross
strokes, back and forth,

33
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,902
sort of like you're making x's.

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,112
OK.

35
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,352
Just very gently bring that together

36
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:49,019
so it's nice and evenly blended.

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,998
OK, let's take and put a,

38
00:01:56,998 --> 00:01:58,490
let's put a little mountain
way in the background,

39
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,569
I use a little bit of
Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown,

40
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,152
a touch of crimson.

41
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:05,813
We'll have a little mountains

42
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:08,729
way back in the distance back here.

43
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:13,854
Something like so.

44
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:19,278
Just a little small one.

45
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:21,347
Now with the large brush,
I'm just gonna take

46
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:25,515
and pull that down, so it
blends it out on the bottom.

47
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:29,750
There we are.

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,771
We just want this mountain
to literally just disappear,

49
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,938
right at the bottom there.

50
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,912
OK, we'll take a little bit of white,

51
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,164
and I'm gonna put the least,

52
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:42,931
least little amount of permanent red in,

53
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:46,703
just to put a little warm
glow on the mountain.

54
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:50,871
Tiny, tiny bit of permanent
red, it's very, very strong.

55
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:57,681
OK, let's run a little highlight,
right down through here.

56
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,400
Don't want these to be too
bright, they wanna be far away.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,233
Very soft.

58
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:09,235
Maybe there's a little highlight
striking right in here.

59
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:14,395
And right down this ridge.

60
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:18,362
For the shadow's side

61
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:22,028
we'll take a little
Prussian blue and white.

62
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,192
There we go.

63
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:29,275
And, just drop some happy
little shadows in here.

64
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,320
And let's just let this one

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,403
wander around and play here a little.

66
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:46,390
Let your heart take you
wherever you wanna go.

67
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:52,161
Maybe there's another
little peak right there.

68
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,631
Each highlight beats
its own private shadow,

69
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:58,463
so just give him a shadow,
so he stands apart.

70
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:05,925
OK, with a clean, dry brush now,

71
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,361
I'm just gonna tap the bottom of this,

72
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,444
just to create some mist.

73
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,485
Over here we'll follow these
angles, then lift upward.

74
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:21,446
Want this one to be very
soft, very far away.

75
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:27,557
OK, now let's take a little
bit of Prussian blue,

76
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:31,682
Van Dyke brown, a little,
tiny bit of sap green,

77
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:35,675
we just mix it on the brush,
put a little white with it.

78
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,980
Let's make a happy little
foothill, comes running down here,

79
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,980
there he is,

80
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:46,173
just let him wander
down here and have fun.

81
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,740
All we're doing is tapping the canvas.

82
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,466
Now you can take and lift gently upward

83
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,757
to make it look like little trees,

84
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:59,174
way, way, way back in the distance there.

85
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:01,819
There we are.

86
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,322
Now then,

87
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,287
maybe, let's do another
one, that was a lot of fun.

88
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:13,431
We'll take some blue and
brown, sap green again,

89
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:14,960
this one we want to be
a little bit darker,

90
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,626
because it's closer,

91
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,866
and we'll just have one run
right down through here.

92
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:25,797
Alright.

93
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,403
It creates a lot of
depth in your painting,

94
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:31,941
and we can just take the
bottom of it and pull down,

95
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,190
and create our reflections.

96
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:41,902
Gently lift upward, make
it look like little trees.

97
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:47,371
There we are.

98
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,822
Just make all kinds of
little projections back here.

99
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:01,396
Now, very gently I'm
gonna just wipe across,

100
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:03,730
to turn it into reflections.

101
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:09,444
OK, we'll take a little
bit of magic white,

102
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:12,194
and make a little waterline here.

103
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:15,574
This is just straight magic white,

104
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:16,780
remember our golden rule here,

105
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,543
a thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

106
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:24,710
So this is very thin, so it
will stick right on there.

107
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,183
OK, let's dull that one
a little bit, too bright.

108
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:39,001
And a little bit right out here.

109
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:44,581
Now we could take a fan brush
using the same dark colors,

110
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:47,935
blue, brown, a little sap green,

111
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:50,430
and we could just drop a few
little indications of trees

112
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,625
back here, maybe these
are a little closer,

113
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,709
just like so.

114
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,217
Don't want to get too much detail yet.

115
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:08,571
Let's darken this one up, it's closer.

116
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:12,215
Then, with just a little
tiny bit of yellow,

117
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:14,295
on the brush here, I'm just
gonna put a little highlight

118
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:17,175
so it looks like this is
beginning to get close enough

119
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:21,341
that we can see things, just
here and there, very little.

120
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:29,899
OK, that gives us a nice
background for a little waterfall.

121
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:30,732
Now.

122
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:36,533
Let's take the large brush,
put some Prussian blue on it,

123
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:40,699
and a little Van Dyke brown,

124
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,884
and here we need to figure out

125
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:44,079
where the waterfall's gonna be,

126
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,483
have to make almighty decisions
when you're the creator.

127
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:49,439
And let's just say it's right here.

128
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,247
Pull straight down, all we're
doing is applying some darks

129
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,247
so our light color will show on top.

130
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:59,170
And, let's throw some down here.

131
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,750
OK, clean the brush, and
we'll be ready to go here.

132
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:18,562
And we'll use the fan brush,

133
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:21,449
and take a little, tiny
bit of the magic white,

134
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,283
and add to firm white,

135
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:27,204
thin paint will stick to a thick paint,

136
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:30,225
so I've thinned it just a little bit here.

137
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:34,350
And we'll put some little
ripples in the water.

138
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,183
Just touch the canvas.

139
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,378
Now, to make the waterfall

140
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,745
pull the brush straight,

141
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,662
and let it fall, pshoo,

142
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:53,706
that's all there there
is to it, straight, fall.

143
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,498
And it'll pay you to
wipe the brush in between

144
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:59,665
because you're gonna pick up
a little bit of that blue.

145
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,339
Tchoo.

146
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,895
Just pull it over, let it fall.

147
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:09,952
That's why they call them waterfalls.

148
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:14,120
OK, let's go over here, pull
it over, and let it fall.

149
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:17,685
Over, and it falls.

150
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,517
Wipe some of that blue off
the brush, over, and fall.

151
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,237
And that's how easy it is
to make a little waterfall.

152
00:09:29,238 --> 00:09:31,689
Now with a little more of the magic,

153
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,480
a little more titanium white,

154
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,134
we can begin letting it hit and splashing,

155
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:40,302
have all kinds of little
fun things happen down here.

156
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,698
OK now, we need to determine

157
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:46,365
what's gonna contain this water,

158
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:51,439
so let's take Van Dyke brown,
just straight Van Dyke brown,

159
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,364
and we'll begin building some little,

160
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:55,889
some little cliffs and rocks,

161
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,219
something's gotta contain this,

162
00:09:57,219 --> 00:10:00,446
be sure your rocks are
higher than the waterfall.

163
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,884
One thing that you have to remember,

164
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:05,033
water's probably the
laziest thing in nature,

165
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,642
it will not climb a rock

166
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:09,141
just so it can fall and be pretty for you.

167
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,127
It'd be nice if it would,
but it won't do it.

168
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:14,631
Alright, let's just fill this in

169
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,048
with a lot of Van Dyke brown.

170
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,317
And, over here, let's come
right along like this,

171
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,567
let this big old stone just play there.

172
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,125
A lot of paint.

173
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,289
Just like so.

174
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,528
Now, we wanna makes these
stones look flat on top,

175
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,923
so I'll take a little burnt umber,

176
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:56,557
mix it with the Van Dyke brown,

177
00:10:56,557 --> 00:11:00,225
maybe just a little
touch of yellow into it.

178
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:03,427
There we go.

179
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:08,645
Now, wanna try to make
this look flat on top,

180
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:13,203
so this, when it comes
across, needs to be like so,

181
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:14,536
to keep it flat,

182
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:16,937
across here.

183
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,192
Just let it go.

184
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:31,894
Say it, Van Dyke, burnt umber, yellow.

185
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:40,386
Let's have this one just
sort of come around, there.

186
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,192
OK.

187
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:49,385
Now, angles, most important thing here,

188
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:51,385
bring these angles down.

189
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,511
A little bit of light color,
just a tiny, tiny bit,

190
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,413
probably the biggest mistake made

191
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:01,269
is putting too much highlight under here,

192
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,173
and you lose that beautiful darkness.

193
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:09,341
Just enough to create a
little illusion of rocks here.

194
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,433
OK, little tiny bit over here,

195
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,433
and you can do this, like
so every once in a while,

196
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,850
just to break it up a little.

197
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,530
There we are.

198
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,932
Angles so, most, most important.

199
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,603
Now let's play with the water a little,

200
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:42,771
maybe it comes up in here and
splashes and has fun, tchoo.

201
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,503
Little more of the magic white,

202
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:47,928
be sure your paint's a little bit thinner

203
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:50,761
than what's on the canvas already.

204
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:56,633
I'm having so much fun with rocks,

205
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,479
think I'll build another
little happy stone

206
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,312
that comes right out through here.

207
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,822
Just using the Van Dyke brown.

208
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,731
And a little bit of our highlight color.

209
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:17,064
Just let that work and play.

210
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:21,952
Little pull downward.

211
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:29,261
OK, let's take a little
bit of the water over here,

212
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:35,071
and, I'm going crazy with stones today,

213
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,749
let's just bring something down like that,

214
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:41,916
maybe there's a big stone
right here in the front.

215
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,317
Remember this is your world,

216
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:49,484
so anywhere you want a stone,
that's where it should be.

217
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:56,021
There we go, we'll just fill all that in.

218
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:00,170
Creates a lot of depth

219
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:03,572
by having all these different
planes in the painting.

220
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:05,779
And, let's put a little
bit of highlight on here

221
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,991
on this happy little stone.

222
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:11,408
Just let that knife barely, barely touch.

223
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:16,089
Barely touch, it almost
touches the canvas.

224
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:20,838
And we can just begin creating

225
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,837
all kinds of almighty stones, rocks.

226
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,235
OK, now, let's build,

227
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:29,543
let's build some happy little things here,

228
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:32,798
using Van Dyke brown and some
burnt umber mixed together,

229
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:35,596
little bit of sap green in it,

230
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:38,348
and let's just put, right over here,

231
00:14:38,349 --> 00:14:42,516
just a happy little tree,
sitting up here on this rock.

232
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:49,944
Like that.

233
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,077
Maybe I'll, maybe over here,
oh, there's an almighty tree.

234
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,198
That's where these big
brushes really work beautiful,

235
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,781
when you wanna make big things.

236
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:10,240
Alright.

237
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:19,444
Here, you have to make decisions
here, where does it go,

238
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:22,486
where is the bottom of this tree?

239
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:23,725
Let's just let it run right on down here

240
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:26,058
and we'll decide that later.

241
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,589
OK.

242
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:32,756
Let's put a few little
limb indications back here,

243
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,435
just here and there,

244
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:37,514
like that.

245
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,437
And, we'll highlight it with
a little brown and white,

246
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,951
least little touch of blue,

247
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:48,283
just to put a little highlight on there.

248
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:55,771
OK, now we'll take some magic white,

249
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,200
to thin the paint a little
bit, we're going to,

250
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:02,033
little bit of yellow,
little bit of sap green.

251
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:08,738
Yellow and sap green, a lot
of paint on the bristles,

252
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:12,517
and let's put some happy
little leaves back in here,

253
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:16,684
just let these little leaves
just fall off your brush,

254
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:21,579
all kinds of little things happening.

255
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:27,800
And go out sometime in the
woods, and, and study trees,

256
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,620
talk to trees, whatever it takes,

257
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,788
tree needs to be your friend
if you're gonna paint him.

258
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,908
Probably out in your yard
you have some beautiful trees

259
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:43,075
that you can look at, study
what happens in a tree,

260
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,923
what makes each one an individual.

261
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,250
Study nature.

262
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,023
I really, I really have some hangups

263
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:57,483
about nature being destroyed,

264
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:01,746
I would like to see nature
remain the way it is.

265
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:05,348
I would like for my son,
his grandchildren maybe,

266
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:08,434
when he goes back to Alaska to
be able to see a real moose,

267
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:12,601
not just pictures of one,
so appreciate what we have.

268
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:17,802
Let's put a big old tree
trunk right up through here,

269
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:20,884
this is just straight Van Dyke brown.

270
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:24,586
There we go.

271
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,234
OK, just fill that in real nice.

272
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,877
There, maybe there's a limb

273
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:43,336
that just travels right
up through this way,

274
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:47,169
your tree, so you put
limbs where you want em.

275
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:55,356
OK, let's take a little
bit of the titanium white

276
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:59,190
with just a touch of
umber in it, burnt umber,

277
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:06,183
and let's just put some
bark on like yesterday.

278
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:08,683
Touch it, pull it to the side.

279
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:10,969
There.

280
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:16,898
Let it run right on up the tree.

281
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,694
OK.

282
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:23,111
Now, back to the magic white.

283
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,257
Little magic white, some yellow,

284
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,605
and I want a darker color on this tree,

285
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:34,817
so I'm gonna use a lot of sap green on it,

286
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:36,234
lot of sap green,

287
00:18:37,544 --> 00:18:41,711
want him to be darker than
the one that's behind him.

288
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:46,985
And we can throw some happy
little leaves right out here.

289
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:54,069
By being darker they stand
apart a little better.

290
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:56,782
There we go.

291
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:02,692
Now, let's make a happy
little bush, right out here,

292
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:05,581
let's put some little
brighter colors on him,

293
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:07,915
so he stands out and shines.

294
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,035
And on down here at the
bottom there's all kind

295
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:19,952
of little things growing
out here on the stone.

296
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,768
OK, maybe this one right here

297
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:29,434
covers up half the tree's foots.

298
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:35,731
This is a very nice little painting,

299
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:39,625
it's a lot of fun to do,
it'll teach you a great deal,

300
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,742
it's a good practice painting.

301
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:44,129
It's also good for putting a happy buck

302
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,713
in your pocket once in a while.

303
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:54,601
There, maybe a little grassy
thing over in there somewhere.

304
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:58,596
And you can also use the
fan brush if you'd like,

305
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:03,041
and just bring all this
together very gently.

306
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,502
Maybe right out here there's a little weed

307
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:07,724
that grows almost on the other side.

308
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:08,557
OK.

309
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:15,132
Now, with the palette
knife, just a clean knife,

310
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:19,013
scrape a few little
trunks and limbs in here.

311
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:20,894
One of the important things
when you're doing this is,

312
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,837
don't kill all this dark
area, you really need it,

313
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:26,081
otherwise your painting
will become very flat.

314
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:27,582
You need the dark.

315
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:33,632
It's the only way you can have light.

316
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:37,675
OK.

317
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:41,880
Let's go over here to the other side,

318
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,790
I think that tree needs a little trunk.

319
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,123
Just touch, touch, touch Van Dyke brown,

320
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:57,944
little bit of highlight on
it, this is brown and white,

321
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:04,014
just enough to give it
some little indications.

322
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:09,792
OK.

323
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:15,836
Now, let's highlight that
tree, a little magic white,

324
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:18,336
a little yellow and sap green,

325
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:21,560
there we are.

326
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:26,555
And, let's just put
some purty little leaves

327
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:28,305
out here on this one.

328
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:35,680
OK.

329
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,032
And down here at the tree's bottom,

330
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,552
let's put a nice little bush right here,

331
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:43,720
this is yellow ochre, beautiful color.

332
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:47,998
Maybe there's a little bush
trying to live down here

333
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:51,748
on this stone, life can
get rough down there.

334
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:57,246
OK, few little sticks
and twigs here and there.

335
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:00,405
But you're beginning to see now,

336
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:03,288
how really very simple it is
to do a happy little waterfall

337
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,954
it's, no big secret.

338
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:09,409
It's quite easy to do.

339
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,576
I'm just throwing a few
little sticks here and there.

340
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:18,056
OK now, we can take the fan brush,

341
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:22,222
little bit of magic white on
it, little bit of firm white,

342
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:25,716
and now we can begin bringing
the water all up through here,

343
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:29,158
just touch and bend the
brush so it bends upward,

344
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,128
and pshoo, once again, tchoo,

345
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:34,634
it makes it look like
water's dripping down,

346
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:36,978
but you pull it upward,

347
00:22:36,978 --> 00:22:40,228
and do it in a real fast little motion.

348
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,401
Water's just going right on out,

349
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:46,318
little bubbly stream out from here.

350
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:49,348
OK.

351
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:52,875
Now another thing that you can do

352
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,355
just to make it look a
little more finished,

353
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:57,634
anytime you have these big cliffs

354
00:22:57,634 --> 00:22:59,698
with little things growing on,

355
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:02,002
you should always have a lot
of little roots that hang over,

356
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:03,034
just take your fan brush

357
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:07,201
with a little tiny bit of
color on it, and pull, like so.

358
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:13,300
Just pull it, makes it look
like little roots hanging over,

359
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,804
ain't that something?

360
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:16,638
There.

361
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:19,792
Just hanging there.

362
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,780
Now, dry the fan brush off.

363
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:30,911
Maybe we'll take the liner
brush, a little Van Dyke brown,

364
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,255
and we'll put a couple little stems

365
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:35,801
and stuff up through here,

366
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,413
maybe, maybe there's a little limb

367
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:42,079
that comes right up through here like so.

368
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,677
This is just a thin oil,

369
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:46,761
just about any type of oil will work,

370
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:49,278
just thins the paint down a little bit,

371
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,752
you may thin it with paint
thinner if you desire,

372
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,365
be careful because paint
thinner will bleed,

373
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:58,532
like ink on rice paper,
be very careful with that,

374
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:03,442
the oil is slick it moves much easier.

375
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:09,183
And we'll have a limb coming
right across the front.

376
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:10,576
When you're doing little trees and stuff,

377
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,223
one thing to avoid,

378
00:24:12,223 --> 00:24:15,711
don't have a trunk and then
limbs coming just off each side,

379
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:17,673
because some of the limbs
are in front of the trunk,

380
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:21,589
some are in the back, so
have them come across,

381
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,540
there we go,

382
00:24:24,492 --> 00:24:28,794
and just gives us a little
something right there.

383
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:32,961
Few little sticks and twigs,
just little finishing touches.

384
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:37,154
And I think I'm beginning
to piddle right now,

385
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:39,413
so I'm gonna take a little bit of the oil,

386
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:41,588
little permanent red,

387
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:46,210
I think it's time we signed
this one and called it finished.

388
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,038
OK, work your oil in there to your paint,

389
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:50,695
it's just like water,

390
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:55,070
and turn the brush to bring
it back to a nice sharp point.

391
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,737
OK, lets go right along in here.

392
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,620
And when you have this
oil very thin like this,

393
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:08,627
it's just about like writing with a pen.

394
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:09,846
Another way you can sign your name

395
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,730
is just take the back of your liner brush,

396
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,164
and you can scrape
right through the paint,

397
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:17,581
your signature will be there.

398
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:23,602
OK, I think we just about
have a finished painting here.

399
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:27,511
Well this is a very, very
fun little painting to do,

400
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,899
it teaches you a great deal,
and I hope it helps you.

401
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,108
If you've enjoyed this, you
know let your PBS station know,

402
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,356
that's the only way we know what you like.

403
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:38,480
Let us hear from you once in a while.

404
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,365
So on behalf of all of
us here at this station,

405
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,836
we'd like to wish you happy painting,

406
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:45,521
and we're looking forward to
seeing you again next week.

407
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:47,938
Until then, have a super day.

408
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:52,545
