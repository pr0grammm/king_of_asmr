# WordCloud of Bob Ross(The Joy of Painting)

I was inspired to create this visualisation after listening to Bob Ross's soothing voice which has often helped me relax.
He is often referred to as the "King of ASMR". ASMR(Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) is a tingling sensation triggered by some gentle stimulus(Often, a particular sound).
